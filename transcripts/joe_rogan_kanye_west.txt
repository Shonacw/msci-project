what's up what's going on man good to see you good to see you too we finally did it we're here we made it happen we're in the building yes sir so what what are you doing you run for president yes what made you decide to do that aren't you busy enough clothing company successful rapper family man it was something that God put on my heart back in 2015 a few days before the

► 00:08:43
Awards to just it hit me in the shower and when I first thought of it I just started like laughing to myself and it looks like all this like Joy came over my over my body just through my soul and I could just I just felt that energy I felt that spirit so then two days later I accepted the Michael Jackson video Vanguard award at the MTV Awards in the eye instead of performing

► 00:09:13
you know my array of hit songs you know I gave just my perspective on award shows but always I knew at the end I was going to tell people I'm running for office I'm running for president in 2020 and you know just to have the it even took heart to say it in that context and people are just like oh like their minds were blown and then I was hanging out with different

► 00:09:44
I had different friends that were you know some people in the music industry some people Tech Elites different things like that and they would really you know they just really took it as a joke and they're telling me all these millions of reasons why I couldn't run for president I remember running into Oprah two days or one day after that she's like yeah I want to be president and you know people just you know thought projecting putting this on you

► 00:10:13
and I remember saying one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was well I'll definitely be a billionaire by that time and not that that's a reason why someone should become president but it's to say you know at that time I was 50 around 50 million dollars in debt and I knew I had the confidence that I would be able to turn that around

► 00:10:44
and now you know just going into it I wanted to give you a that that's a clear answer well I want it I know you saying I don't want to go off onto of no it's okay it's yeah we're basically saying is you know how to set goals you know to achieve them but what was Oprah's rationale which he said you don't want to be the president like what was she saying because I remember when people were saying that's our next president member when Trump got elected you know they showed Oprah and they were set like there was I believe it was like NBC to

► 00:11:13
I did it this is our next president like they were a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run and they felt like if Trump could win Oprah could win when I saw Trump when I was like see you can win outside and I was you can win if you're coming from outside of politics I was young when Ronald Reagan was in was President I don't remember Ronald Reagan was the governor of California before it was the president who actually proven himself as a politician at least somewhat which is an idea that people have thrown out at me too

► 00:11:43
you to be Governor California to be Governor McAuliffe anyone's better than this guy just do to this guy Head Start there yeah shot open things up again man but I think I think my calling is to be I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the Free World

► 00:12:06
now that I mean if it's in God's plan that part of my path is to be the governor then that's fine but my calling is to be the leader of the Free World So when you say this like when you say you're calling is to be the leader of the Free World what does that mean to you does that does it mean do you have a plan that's different than the plans have been implemented before does it mean that you have idea what kind of plan like the plan to be the leader like what would you do if you were the leader of the fleet of the Free World like what would be different about the way you would handle things

► 00:12:36
like if that's your plan like what is it about that that that is your calling like why would you want to do that like what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the Free World well well there is a couple questions in there you said why is you know why is that your calling there's people say to me you know they'll say well music is bigger than politics or more influential than politics are celebrities are more influential and

► 00:13:07
I thought of it like if I was a pastor of a hundred thousand person church but then I was also a captain a sailor and then we went to war and I said I'm gonna man this ship that has a thousand people thousand soldiers on it because God is calling me

► 00:13:28
to take this position even though I'm the pastor for you know however big my audience is in hip-hop and music or as a just an influencer celebrity or just as a dad and a husband in my house the world is like

► 00:13:54
they couldn't be a better time to put a Visionary in the in the captain's chair and that's not to say we haven't had Visionaries be before I'm not coming here to down any of the other I'm not here to down tromp down Biden I'm just here to express why

► 00:14:22
why God has called me to take this position so when you say a Visionary you think of yourself in terms of like as an artist as a Creator some someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and art creation designed the things that you do that's why you think you're different as a visionary

► 00:14:45
yeah I I think that I think I'm different from I mean we're all different so I'm definitely different from everybody we're all different from each other I'm an do bump into people that seem to be like the same character inside of yeah it's like people before yeah people play the same roles like I just met you before that you yeah just like the head of this company over here you're saying kind of person yeah you know I mean I'm manifest I see things

► 00:15:14
I'm a great leader because I listened and I'm empathetic and I feel the entire Earth and I feel us as a as a species as the the human race like I did sometimes people think that Utopia as almost like a negative word that's that's like we couldn't have that but I do believe in World Peace like the people hit me with the all one of the things Oprah said is she said you got to Bone up on your

► 00:15:44
your Foreign Affairs I remember this like because it's Oprah talking summer remember a lot of what the conversation was but that's the first thing she said was you know Foreign Affairs and foreign policies like just I think the reason why I say leader and that politician and not even specifically president is

► 00:16:08
this is the time you know when the Constitution was written that was an innovation now the world is innovated all around our political system but we have an innovated and simplified our political system so I met with this gentleman Sam one of the founders of Y combinator so Y combinator is a a is a contract that

► 00:16:37
friend that had a Dropbox use and that a lot of tech guys use and it's a standardized deal so one of the ideas I had when I was as I'm in this process of innovation that in I'm not in war with the music industry it's just it's time for us to innovate and we need to have contracts that makes sense with exactly how we sell music so you know people every vicinity and that's like every 20 years that's like the

► 00:17:07
like decade is 10 of sending as 20 and as you see now it's like the world is just stopped for a second and there's an opportunity to look and say what are the things we need what are the things we don't need so I don't know if you saw when I posted my contract I had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth and there's things that we don't need now I believe that the distribution

► 00:17:32
partner that the label is like Prince would go and say oh we don't need the distribution partner especially of Prince was you know really alive and thriving in this internet era I'm the kind of person where I'm not trying to go and eliminate anyone's job so record labels are afraid of saying okay we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you guys which is you know that's a possibility there's a way

► 00:18:02
we're both parties can be happy and that these infrastructure Partners can be of service to the influencer to the artists like these deals can be

► 00:18:18
flipped in a way that they're just more fair you know of record and I just let me just go into this specific place with the record labels for a second yeah I'm talking about this is confusing thing for people on the outside yeah so before when I told my father I wanted to rap he was very like leery of that ID said this this I heard this business is terrible and you know he's right

► 00:18:48
like people are all seeing things that are wrong inside a contracts turning blind eyes to it and everyone's responsible everyone's a part of it you know it's like when the me to movement happened you know it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged and you know some of the guys should have got hit with his some guy shouldn't you know that's not what I'm here to talk about I'm saying that in a way everyone's responsible everyone's a part of the problem that's why I really love that

► 00:19:18
Black Mirror episode when you know everyone was making comments and anyone that even made a comment the bees it was about these you know mechanical bees anyone in this is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen that episode but anyone who made a comment the bees came to go get them and that's the thing about what you put in the universe even a thought you know you put that thought into these it's another thing to say something negative and put that into the

► 00:19:48
the universe is another thing to see someone being raped you know that's the reason why I compare what's happening to in the music industry to me too because artists are raped you've heard that term before I'm not this and that like I'm this and that like a new thing that I'm making up the the contracts are made to rape the artist and you know I put my like I think about

► 00:20:15
you know this is like a thought right now it's like is this a negative thought that I'm putting into the universe but I have to say like when I was going on Twitter I was thinking about Bruce and Brandon Lee that cross my mind to say I'm this is Sony this is universal and I'm willing to put the blue

► 00:20:35
paint on my face and go out and do this

► 00:20:42
because it's the right thing to do like music like at this point it loses me money it doesn't make it doesn't make me money does my five billion dollar net worth and 300 million dollars of cash that I see a year music is like negative 4 million for me so these contracts for me were kind of like waingro and heat where this guy had everything but he still said waingro messed up this this

► 00:21:12
this Heist that we're going to do like I look at the music industry that music and the love of Music itself but the music industry I look at it like waingrow like I Blame You Know

► 00:21:26
the loss of my mother partially on entered the entertainment industry the always fighting to you know represent you know who you are against media entertainment industry that's trying to tear down anybody that's not going with the flow I see you know I've got those kind of reasons personally but vengeance is mine saith the Lord so it's not a matter of going

► 00:21:56
in for Revenge that's just me as a human being where I fall short like I'm not a monk can you explain what you're talking about with Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee like what I lost you there okay so Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered

► 00:22:10
well Brandon Lee died in an accident on a movie set yeah you think it was a murder I felt that the conspiracy right the conspiracy was that the Chinese Triad killed him the same way they killed Bruce but does the the coroner's report was that Bruce died from a reaction to a medication right yeah I mean but I think about that anytime I go to the go to the hospital I'm very

► 00:22:37
you know I'm mindful of that stuff you think about like Bob Marley they didn't just JFK or MLK him there's like reports that it was something in his toe or he had cancer right believe he had skin cancer yeah like I went to go I got a shot in my my hand because just from texting and stuff my thumb was like hurt and then I've told him so much you hurt your thumb absolutely just text him way too much so I post a picture

► 00:23:08
of the screen at the hospital and then I was asked to take it down

► 00:23:16
bye-bye who people just call my forgetting exactly who asked me but it was like they get they got to my management they got to this and he said take that picture down like the hospital it was in the weirdest place you know so what did they not like about the picture I think it had like it might have had some information on it that they didn't want to go out like an address or something like that and that's just like but I don't want to go down go down this Rabbit Hole so I'm just saying like

► 00:23:46
Michael Jackson not waking up one day Prince not waking up one day Bruce and Brandon Lee Bob Marley all of these things are have crossed my mind you know as I'm going and saying I need to innovate with these contracts are not just for me but for all artists it's not about me getting my master's back it's about

► 00:24:14
it's about freedom and I say on a new song I say if I would put myself In Harm's Way to get my Master's they would put their self In Harm's Way to stay the master and that's there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way the world currently works and the influence that America has on other countries and the way government's work the influence

► 00:24:44
the way government and the way people in power and control deal with

► 00:24:51
you know disaster relief deal with Haiti deal with the Bahamas like where is the money going why aren't things being built and this concept of money right I ask myself this

► 00:25:09
I asked someone we could go like how much is America and debt and they were like this many trillion and then I asked my a rhetorical question but the dumbest question I've ever asked myself I said well you know how much does the earth cost think they like a bad question but but I'm not just your with worth yeah what is what is the Air Force what it all the things on Earth yeah and it's saying we can't buy it we couldn't make enough money to buy the Earth right so that means

► 00:25:38
we made money so if money is the key to all people's happiness and will solve everything and everyone's doing things for money let's just make more money but it's not about making more money it's about keeping poor people poor and rich people rich and keeping people keeping people in their place and right now we're experiencing the fall of Rome or the Titanic has now hit a glacier and there's people who would prefer to

► 00:26:08
to go down with the Titanic then to get on a Lifeboat because they don't want to get sea water on their dress or on the nice outfit the people are so programmed and brainwashed into classism and protectionism that it's difficult for people to embrace Innovation unless it has a tag on it it's got a name brand connected to it that says with this Innovation you will be better

► 00:26:38
in the person you'll be better than your next door neighbor you know when I met Sunday service I completely stop rapping because I didn't know how to rap for God you know all my raps always had like you know like nasty jokes on it and and then you know I made made when I when I went to the hospital I know you want to get into this what I went to the hospital in 2006

► 00:27:08
teen I wrote start a church in Calabasas and as we left from 2018 going into 2019 I said I'm not going to let one Sunday go by without starting this church and there's people said it wasn't a church and different things but to start a Ministry I'm like the Little Drummer Boy what I'm saying you know this all I got to bring my my drum I might not be well versed in the word and but I know how to do make music I don't know how to put this choir together and all things can be made good for

► 00:27:38
Todd so it like quickly became the best choir of all time because all the best singers moved to California and now but a lot of them grew up in the church so it's like the opportunity from you for them to actually get paid singing for God because I would be funding it and that for me was like a tithe for me to fund Sunday service and I was four months in before I gave my life to God like I wasn't saved it's just I had a calling saying just go make this church and the

► 00:28:08
the whole thing that the comparison to this church to me going and saying okay why why am I running for president is to be in service and that service to my my own ego you know I feel like God says to me like haven't I given you enough and I gave you an ego that helped you overcome all these you know Roblox and smoke screens and people telling you what you can't do now you need

► 00:28:38
realize when you're doing things for your ego and when you're doing things for me this is like God what I feel God is saying to me because it really irritates me when people say God told me to tell you so I'm very like mindful with this kind of word in this I'm saying I have a feeling that that's what God is saying for me to be in service so the ultimate service position is

► 00:29:07
leader of the Free World to be the president of the United States it's sometimes you see me on Twitter I say I want all the smoke I want all the problems because the problems are the opportunities is an opportunity to solve things and Kurzweil he created the keyboard Kurzweil he he has his video that Mark romantic this director that shot 99 problems for Jay Z which is like my favorite may be like top five or top two favorite

► 00:29:36
of all time he also did a closer for Trent Reznor and I like I just grew up on MTV in the 90s and I love Mark romantic videos but he would share he chair little bits and pieces I remember Ray curls Kurzweil talking about the ability for us to have a Utopia but us being led by the least Noble and the most greedy but if someone or when someone gets in and

► 00:30:06
position of leadership

► 00:30:11
that is in service to God and in service to people. But immediately the American people had is your guy was saying like man no one outside of our country should be able to see these debates this is family business right here this is only for America to see we can't let anyone outside the country see but to be in service so I stepped away already from my rap career

► 00:30:40
here for a year and served God every week sometimes twice a week three times a week never missed a Sunday until covid and and this is thing there were people inside of the church stealing doing different things trying to just take the money and God still provided a way for us to keep that boat afloat we never missed a we never missed a service and then one of my pastors Pastor Adam

► 00:31:10
who is the way he preaches is called expository it's like 121 by the word I like all different kind of preachers but there's some type of preachers they they get up they have the Bible in their hand and they closed the Bible and then they just talk for two hours and it's and and some do have anointing but the expository preachers go line for line and for me it's like I come from entertainment I got so much sauce

► 00:31:40
don't need no sauce on the word I need the word to be solid food that I can understand exactly what God was saying to me through the King James version do this you know through this translation or the English Standard Version so Pastor Adams was coming by my spot I got this 300 acres spot in Calabasas that we had a little house in that I was recording and I would play this music these chords that I love they're

► 00:32:10
almost like monk like and that's going to go into some we'll talk about later because I'm building a - I'm building them a monastery that would be then be the future of monasteries this like full sustainable energy now he says to me Pastor Adam says to me when I was thinking about should I wrap or not he said my son just said you know I wish I want to hear ye rapped new album about Jesus a rap album about Jesus and it was through the mouths of babes

► 00:32:40
like this person I'm going to listen to the kids bro you know I'm going to listen to my daughter I'm going to listen to kids before I listen to you know super programmed out adults and especially if that adult hasn't done something that I am looking to do so it's so funny how people are so like free and almost Arrogant with their advice and I'm just like why would I listen to you you don't even ask me for any advice on

► 00:33:10
I'm the most successful person I know so the

► 00:33:16
so he said my son wants to hear a rap album from yay and that just that was that was the paradigm shift for me I use that word a lot I like that I like paradigm shift is one of my favorite the and I made this rap album and you know for a lot of people it was the first album that they could play with the certain production level in the house with their with their with their family now you know you could argue if the Watch the Throne

► 00:33:45
production was Stronger better than Jesus is King production but when I go and I like I've been working with dr. Dre and some of the Beats just be like you know the hardest beats possible and it's something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on Jesus king that it wasn't hitting as hard as Yeezus or hitting his heart as a Watch the Throne it was like this is how God wanted me to

► 00:34:15
to make this make this Sonic painting and the way he wanted me to communicate then so we did that album and then we did the Jesus is born album which also I got that idea from Pastor Adams and I mean there's people who that's the only album they play and it's just bringing these gospel and I tell you like my formula for these hymns I'm writing because I'm writing the songs that we're doing at

► 00:34:45
Sunday service is basically my book of hymns for the future gospel University that I'm creating where I've envisioned and will manifest a 200,000 seat Stadium circular with a hundred thousand gospel singers and people will go to this University and they will train the way you know a Russian Olympic swimmer you know a picture like this

► 00:35:15
they would be in the pool six days a week at least if not seven days but for people who sing for the church or you know you know because it's it's a tide its Pro bonus all this like people don't practice that as much as we practice going to Studio to wrap or practice playing basketball a friend the NBA so it's making the MBA so to say the Coliseum for God and what that have

► 00:35:45
have you like heard like soccer chance and I and just like 60,000 purse so I envisioned that for God a hundred thousand people sometimes singing In Harmony sometimes in unison Gloria Glory oh God all my we lived our hands and give you praise clothes or

► 00:36:15
oh God Almighty we lived our hands and give you prayer Chloe but pitch a hundred thousand people in unison and that feeling what that would do for our Spirits our souls it's healing there's natural forms of healing about our environment the friends that were around what we're wearing what we're eating our diet so

► 00:36:45
is the design company that that I formed around 10 years ago and some of the people that worked at donned our now have went on to become heads of fashion houses like Virgil's the head of Louis Vuitton and he was the head of dhunda at a certain point another guy that worked or donda is now the head of Javon she so this is like the the talent pool and this has donned is basically my version of like a cyber you know extension of my

► 00:37:15
brain like there's something that I'm thinking of that you can't touch but we need to we need to bring into fruition we need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our Now to create our future so it's a organization created to guarantee the future of the human race really I thought about even calling it Edna because I see us all the superheroes and Aetna was the designer in The Incredibles where

► 00:37:45
kind of almost really similar to donned I'm just seeing these lineups and stuff so so now our focus is food clothing shelter communication education and transportation so at the school that I just created easy Christian Academy you know we call NASA we call different places about this hydroponic vertical growing garden and I remember sitting you know the idea of the garden is from A to Z

z you have to be able to make your food right there fully sustainable right there on your land and you know it's a bunch of people like I made this salad right here it's like I'm at that good enough you still got to go to the grocery store for 80% 60% of yourself I remember this one you know this one farmer we had you know he wanted to build this class for the kids and all this I'm going to show the kids this they people always make the kids version I don't like this the kids version thing like kids need to

► 00:38:45
stand how what of the pandemic was you know they lost all their parents and it was also the kids need to understand early how real life works so physics is one of the anchors of the school that I'm creating I remember you know I'm the city is all self-sustaining so it works off of our four main resources earth when water and and fire and 90% of it is running off of water with like aqueduct

► 00:39:15
it's like the city of Masada and I was talking to this engineer and saying I need the whole thing to run off of water and he said well we're going to have to use solar power and I said I don't and please you know don't take this as any offense I don't like solar panels I feel that they're part of still of what Edison's I did was I don't feel like they're really in line with Nikolai Tesla really wanted to do with alternative current we get into the whole Tesla and what Edison did to take

► 00:39:45
slow down and the fact the world would probably be free by now if Ted is of Tesla wasn't basically destroyed by the media that Edison controlled in the propaganda that Edison control so I'm talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and I don't want to use a solar anyway and he says no I'm saying we're going to use a mirror and it's going to connect to a steam engine and that's going to push the water back up and I was like after like screaming at the guy

► 00:40:15
I was like look if I had known physics I wouldn't have been screaming at my engineer so if we think about what we're learning in school to learn physics to learn farming I was I was talking to

► 00:40:29
a friend of mine that's a rapper and super super god following spiritual super smart and I was showing her the some of the designs for the monasteries and some of the designs for the fully sustainable communities all the same thing and then it said bioengineering on it and she said what do you like for her bio engineering has a negative connotation and my

► 00:40:58
this was isn't like farming and cooking like bioengineering at the at the simplest form like we went to going from like grab an apples off of a tree to oh we put this boom and the ground oh and we can grow this and we could grow this you know we could grow this Harvest right here so it's you know I want to just simplify around up the the principle behind the donda way of thinking is

► 00:41:27
we've got all this information and all this you know these scientists the scientific exploration these things that Tesla never completed these things that DaVinci never completed and

► 00:41:43
we can look at all of these things and see how do we create the most primitive versions of this to create a fully sustainable ecosystem which is you know what covid actually helped us to you know get closer to our families get closer to our children understand like oh wow that you know that was mapped out for us to be 50 minutes away from our home and our kids school to be 30 minutes away and to put us in traffic for that amount of time and these cities have been designed

► 00:42:13
to promote industry and just to make more money they haven't been designed to promote happiness so we're at this paradigm shift in our existence you know it was when Muhammad hit the market I think that's who it was and brought money because before it was slave and trade and this is something you know dishonorable men honor money I got this bar from Dave Chappelle I'm not trying to like steal his bar and you know we as human beings is this race on

► 00:42:43
Earth have like been honoring money and you know money isn't it's not even real you know it's not even backed by anything I don't want to like go too far into that but when you um program yourself you see that there's other forms of currency now like relationships are a more important currency than money itself and that's what we really saw it's like the end of the movie that our existence would be pre covid post covid and so as the Titanic is

► 00:43:13
crashing and sinking and Rome is falling there's got to be this new civilization like the end of Tron where everything starts to light up and it's been under this like dark clouds so you know God is using me and he has a calling you know in my life to make the world better for all people like people say it's bad people there's good people know there's there's people that are possessed that have demonic ways but we were all children were at one time is it

► 00:43:43
some people know they were born bad you got to remember like say oh there's bad people even even the devil's an angel a fallen angel a lost Angel like Los Angeles if you think let me but that's the City of Angels let me let me let me start from the beginning so you essentially deconstruct things so when you say in many ways when you're describing yourself as a Visionary this is what I'm saying is that you're looking at all the systems that

► 00:44:13
that are in place whether it's the record industry the contracts that are wrong with artists that we civilization is set up I think Visionaries love glossy and too Saucy of a title okay whatever engineer unit your deconstructing all of these things and you find flaws in the systems so all these systems whether it's the the music industry system whether it's the political system whether it's the the system of gathering food whether even a religious system like I remember when you started doing your

► 00:44:43
the service and my friend was like what is he doing I go he's making going to church cool again like you don't think that's a look at all these people having a great time you've thousands of people that are chanting and singing along I'm he's not asking for anything look if anybody should be doing something like that it's him ago because he's making great music everybody's having a good time and what do you get out of that the best thing that people ever get out of church is sense of community a time when you get together and you all agree this is

► 00:45:13
are you going to concentrate on good you're going to concentrate on goodness you're going to concentrate on trying to find these shared values that are going to help the community now you doing this in this Mass form you get the Superstar musician who's doing this in this Mass form with thousands and thousands of people in these gigantic areas like that's nothing but positive so you deconstructed the idea of how to do a religious service but make it cool and now you're thinking about deconstructing all these different things you're thinking about

► 00:45:43
directing how how food is harvested you're thinking about deconstructing how we make energy you're literally trying to deconstruct and reimagine the idea of civilization yeah exactly so we talk me through how this starts with you have you you always religious your whole life yes I was and then I you know then I hit high school now it's so but you know when you're a young man and you're

► 00:46:13
you know you're a superstar musician and you know you live in a wildlife what what was it that led you back to this just a feeling in your life that there was more to life there was more to your position there was more to you know this idea of a calling that you felt like you could do more and that it resonated with you more to to produce these Sunday services and to start thinking of of life in this way

► 00:46:43
you can improve things their God knock me off my horse God like literally call me and said okay now I need you I need you right now I need I mean not that God needs needs me we need God but he called me to serve him and I was tired of serving the music industry to start tired of serving you know filling up stadiums you know when the last concert

► 00:47:13
and last tour I did we had a floating stage and and actually was a hanging stage but it looked like it was floating and that's just another thing that's illusion where we need to dispel the illusion I would even call it the floating stage today but the whole thing about his people used to say how I would lose money on tours because I will put so much into the creative and I and I was like wanted to prove approved to who you know prove to man proved too greedy people you know that I could make more than anybody and that's like the Gladiators

► 00:47:43
our position that all artists are put into like we're in the middle of this Coliseum let me show you I can kill more lions and tigers and bears and people and both bought than than any other Gladiators that happened so that's what I'm that's what I was doing and then I remember talking to James Turrell and I was like at the top of my lungs like screaming about saving saving ourselves and humanity and the reason why me and James needed to connect and then I went to my show

► 00:48:13
show and then it's like my like the like my head popped back in the spirit jumped out and felt like it was like my mom talking and the last thing I said was this thing is over and I'm saying it like I sound like my mom like donda like that's something she would have said if she was in the physical form when she sees her son you know exhausted like I did just went through a I had this fashion show we

► 00:48:43
this fashion show where we took over MSG and just broke all boundaries so twenty thousand sixteen thousand seats and play the new album and it was you know a thousand black people in the show and yeah like all the Young Thug plugging in the iPhone and Travis and Cuddy dancing at 50 Cent there Jay-Z there Lamar Odom the the first time that people you know saw him and walk again

► 00:49:13
was we walk together into the into the stadium and he's camo Yeezy jacket all a head-to-toe and the reason why that is so important is like when he was in a coma I would come by and play him the new music and once he was out of the coma he said that he remembered that music when he was in a coma and that was the album I was playing that day so that's the reason why me and Lamar walked in together and then the next

► 00:49:43
a few months later I did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late and the media they just killed me they LeBron to me as I would say like when LeBron went to to Miami and they said you know who are you to have a choice you know like what one of my other Heroes Tom Brady he left I didn't see no jerseys getting burned like when LeBron left so then less than a

► 00:50:13
week after that my wife is robbed in Paris and so we we just because I'm in the middle of tour while I'm doing the fashion show I'm doing this so we cancel the tour because it's very you know traumatic and then you know we start the tour back up and we get back into it and then I just keep on saying I want to go to Japan I just want to go to Japan because Japan is like a way that people

► 00:50:43
treat there isn't like this systemic racism embedded in every single individual that's inside of the place like in America black white anything there's a systemic whitest white supremacy like but I tagged you know white supremacy or we say this it's like the yes that is America that is the world currently we've been taught that my first superhero was Superman you know and my dad was a black panther

► 00:51:13
ether but you know when Disney makes black panther now when you look it up you don't see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mic out of somebody's hand while they're lying I don't know you know like father like son right there but you see this character that's made for black people to idolize that was designed by white right person and put out by white company so it's controlling the narrative to say

► 00:51:43
we're going to show you Harriet Harriet Tubman we're not going to show you not Turner and they do every chance they get Maleficent they called her race of people the Moors and the Moors are and I just saw it again I was just like yo if you erase our history like most black people we don't know where we come we think we came from slaves we don't know our bloodline and we're

► 00:52:13
given Black History Month and we take that like it's some gift to us know it's a programming to us racism doesn't end until we get to a point where we stopped having it put the word black in front of it because it's like we're putting the rim a little bit lower for ourselves like it's when I say I'm the second wealthiest black man in America like why do I have to say that because you know obviously if we just go on wealth period of

► 00:52:43
we call Wealth like Financial wealth that scorecard you know I'd be like I'm the I'm the 78th wealthiest man in America but we shouldn't have to have a special box a special month because also what they show in black black history month is us getting hose down reminding us that we were slaves like what if we had remember when I cheated on you month like remember when you first found the found the text messages remember how does that make you feel

► 00:53:13
it makes you feel depleted and defeated you know it's no matter what religion you are we can agree on as it is always now but now is the shortest moment of our life

► 00:53:26
it's gone in an instant the longest moments of our life are our memories and our imaginations think about how long a kid imagines Christmas before I mean versus how long Christmas really is and when you think back to your Christmas are you under the table like Jim Carrey and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind like under a chair or are you a giant are you a king are you what black what what black history month has told you you are on this is me speaking to

► 00:53:56
you know black people specifically in America that you know I know people who would you know kill someone and or have a gunner you know in their own hood and be afraid to go downtown and literally be like afraid of white people like the most gangster gang of gangsters wouldn't go downtown and that's just a programming but that program is inside of the curriculum

► 00:54:26
and it's inside of the media it and it and it goes to this whole idea of yay when people say is Jay crazy is yay narcissistic is Jay egomaniac is Jay self-absorbed of J All Things No yay no who yeah is I know who I am and I'm not Finn I'm not fit to bow to to an idea that you want to have me

► 00:54:56
I am going to be the full idea that God has of me and when I do things that are that God don't like I'm I'm being the Lesser version of me this is where you know and my weakness God becomes strong I have to be the higher me when when people are doubting me it's not like me fighting fire with fire and me attacking or it's you say like

► 00:55:26
you know stooping to stooping to that level it's like the devil will use you against you you become your own you become Your Own Worst Enemy and I just went on a riff right there but the thing is these isn't that what you do look at ya one of the things that I know when anybody ever talks about you to me they they say well he's all over the place I say I think that he's got a different power sources

► 00:55:56
is like if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world is if there's a universal power most people have like a 20 watt charger the way I described you I say I think that motherfuckers got like a hundred fifty watt charger and these ideas are just coming at them so you do go on these rants that sometimes need to be dissected into individual things but overall your intent incredibly productive so my question is

► 00:56:21
why do you why do people think there's something wrong with you yeah this is but I little legitimately like you've been medicated they've put you away right they've brought to Men to Men how did that happen well well I'll say these two things I think very three-dimensionally I don't think in the black and white lines that I've been programmed to think in and I think in full color so when I'm talk I have to describe a thought

► 00:56:52
in five ways you know we enjoy food that has multiple seasoning in it we enjoy music that has multiple instruments so when I talk it's not a rant is a symphony yes of ideas and when you collect them you say all these are all these things that connect yeah you know I just tell the truth and telling the truth is crazy in a world full of lies

► 00:57:20
that's simply it but none of the things you're saying you're crazy another things you said a crate it's fascinating the way you think because I can see that you're thinking and all these different layers and you looking at things from all these different perspectives and they all come together out of your mouth in like a tornado of ideas now if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth I could see whether we go the guys crazy just doesn't stop he was ranting but what I'm seeing is just your a very thorough thinker you're thinking it things

► 00:57:50
dependently but you're thinking of things in the massive perspective Who convinced you that that's bad is it have you always been this way or were you less is it wasn't less manageable before did you have issues with it before yeah I believe before I found Christ and gave my life to God I would try to lean on my own understanding and that's the universe is

► 00:58:21
like a black hole of information we gain by your own understanding meaning when people ask Einstein said you're the smartest person what would you like to know he and his it Ryan Stein's response was I'd like to understand the mind of God meaning meaning God is all-knowing and we can only know her see and for me as a Visionary we can only know or see what God allows us to see and what he feels were ready to see and understand to

► 00:58:51
ice what are Maslow's hierarchy in each art is you know what sets our dopamine's what sets our serotonins off what makes us feel good basically like you know we did a good deed and it's like it was somehow where you know you know just doing a beat for a famous person or just doing a beat for a local dope rapper really meant a lot to me when I was 14 years old doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal

► 00:59:20
was a lot to me at age 19 me being able to you know put out my own music and put my own I was a lot to me at age 24 meaning as I grow God sets new stages in The Game of Life for me that you get your satisfaction like Maslow's hierarchy of need is like our satisfaction chart what makes us feel whole and accomplished as a as a as a human being so as I go through these different levels

► 00:59:51
times where I would use confidence when I knew what I was doing and I would use arrogance when I didn't know what I was doing but I rather use arrogance then the let someone diminish my idea of myself because that is what keeps us going hope actually Keeps Us Alive anybody as most people's like do you want tomorrow to come and they say yes they have they have hope for it but I went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith and faith is the opposite of fear

► 01:00:20
ear and that created this Fearless approach that I have and that's what made now has made me the fearless leader that I am that I've like crystallized into the leader that my mom always knew I would be when kids follow me and preschool the leader that people saw when we change the sound of music The Leader when we changed the the sneaker industry the leader and what we're doing with with

► 01:00:50
coming with with shelters when I was building you know the homeless shelters a couple years ago and visiting parks and then going to skip row and understanding the the Dynamics and empathizing what actual mental health issues are that someone you know telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such like I am so that's what you felt happened to you

► 01:01:20
you like you were absolute truth and you were exhausted and they labeled you as mentally unhealthy yes absolutely my saying is right that what happened with you is you feel like maybe or you probably feel like that having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the glue that kept your thoughts together they kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path

► 01:01:49
so instead of being scattered with all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted and being labeled manic right like we talked before and you were saying that they had you on medication but the medication fuck with your creativity it fucked with all kinds of things oh and block my ability to channel what God wanted me to do but we're all we're all on medication right now did you use toothpaste with fluoride today it blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it and we put we put our kids on it you know

► 01:02:19
we it's inside the the deodorants that we use is all these things to create like a disconnect to God to serve that it's like are you serving man are you serving the the one and only Master what did they tell you when they said that they're going to put you on medication what do they put you on and what what did they tell you one of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made me gain a lot of weight and I said I'm not going to take this and they said okay we

► 01:02:49
got a medication you can take what you don't gain weight and this shows you they were trying to kill a superhero slowly trying to kill genius trying to make me not feel like I could run for president make me not feel like I can go be born and Atlanta grew up on the south side of Chicago go into music going when all these grammies change the sound of music and the lookup stage performances all that and then still end up in 53

► 01:03:19
million dollars a debt what music industry has people going to the exact debt of the house that they think they're going to buy after the tour is over and it's and it's and strategize is criminals all over everyone's almost accounts in the music industry it's not a safe place it's a it's a treacherous place so with money yeah those things are filled with money they're filled with people that are trying to take advantage of other people it's filled with money but he's come to honey exactly so they put

► 01:03:49
they put you on this ship because you were exhausted what did they put you on

► 01:03:57
you know I'm I can I can research I'm like no I'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they had what did you do the main thing that I did

► 01:04:10
is

► 01:04:14
it destroyed my confidence it maybe this shell of who I really am it like grade over my eyes it made me

► 01:04:28
it made the Mustang that buck anymore

► 01:04:32
they said they did you yes yeah and they what was the thought process behind it we talk to a doctor about this what do they tell you is wrong with you

► 01:04:45
they they told me I was bipolar and I remember going on TMZ and saying you know slavery is a choice and they medicate it me for saying that for having that opinion and saying it out loud but as I put those contracts up I'm saying this is the choice as I you know you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into chains was a choice

► 01:05:15
what you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them financially and enslave their life yeah it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least charitable way and they decided to try to say look at crazy Kanye look at this shitty saying yeah then they medicate you yes and the media is always taken anything out of context that isn't a part of the overall narrative yeah that because there's

► 01:05:45
is you know like Hollywood and media has control so much of the narrative and then he had Silicon Valley and that's what's so beautiful about one of my heroes Steve Jobs because there wouldn't be a Silicon Valley or with the Silicon Valley wouldn't be what it is today if Steve Jobs didn't make information accessible like this which is still a bit control but it feels like Twitter is

► 01:06:16
the the safest Fleet Frias Mass platform to communicate on and you know it's like they messed with Jack because of that you know you know well it's still censored there's a lot of issues now but I think that's internal I think that's people that are working there that are woke that want to stop people from saying certain things and there's a lot of struggles with that today and I it's unfortunate because I do agree that it's an

► 01:06:45
of a way to get ideas out there yeah so but it's also it's a new thing and it's mismanaged by the people that use it often they don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it every version of anything that man has made will be flawed sure and it has to go through a bunch of different steps of evolution it has to has to evolve and change so why did you agree to let them do this to you why why did you agree to let the Medicaid you

► 01:07:16
because if that if that like I'm crazy for sure but if someone came to me and go hey we're going to put you on some medication that medication is going to calm you down I'd be like

► 01:07:27
everything I do is because I'm not calm everything that I've ever done that's made me successful is because I have more energy is because I have a wildness like I'm not common that down like I know how to calm myself down I can self-medicate with exercise and meditation and marijuana and a bunch of different things but I'm not gonna I'm not going to take some medication that removes anything that's unique

► 01:07:51
with you and all these wild ideas that come to your head like very few people could string together these thoughts the way you're describing of today if somebody asked me is anything wrong with him I was just fucking He's filled with awesome like what's wrong with that if you can keep that together what you just did the way you just described reimagining civilization reimagining Church reimagining the Food Supplies there's nothing bad about that this is all very interesting and very good like I would never say that it's bad but are you this way

► 01:08:21
the time or is there a good versions of Kanye and versions of Kanye where you don't feel like you have a grip on these these thoughts you know what I love is there was some perspectives that people showed about what a true manic episode really looks like after I was in South Carolina and this one guy was talking about his mom

► 01:08:49
being an episode and kidnapping his brother and you know like proper extreme cases you know I cried and was gut wrench like at the I don't even like to say out loud what I what I said on South Carolina but the idea of you know hmm I'm just trying to word it in a way that's really safe and

► 01:09:19
my family people saw this clip of me crying some people didn't know what I was crying about but I was crying about

► 01:09:32
that there is a possible chance yeah I'm just I'm looking at a way to say this I know I was going to say that there was a chance that

► 01:09:44
you know that we didn't make that Kim and I didn't make the family we have today I will that's much that's my most like family-friendly you know way to word that and just the idea of it just tears me up inside that I was a part of a culture that promotes this kind of thing like one of the major statistics on the subject of life is

► 01:10:14
that the greatest advocates for the a the a word is our men from ages 31 to 37 and that's how old I was and I felt like I was too busy my dad felt like he was too busy for me

► 01:10:38
and we have a culture of that and they have a child Rebel soldiers that were in Africa that would be doped up and psyched out and made to kill their parents were well in our culture we're doped up and psyched out and made to kill our children you know we have to decouple the conversation of Planned Parenthood

► 01:11:08
and woman's choice now so of course I'm Christian so I'm pro-life and when I go into office I'm that

► 01:11:21
changing laws because I realized we live in an imperfect world and the imperfect Society what I will be presenting as a plan a and we've already started to work on plan a to change the connotation of orphanages to change the connotation of foster care and that just changed the connotation you know verbally but to create places that are to the level of like the Aman girion dizzy world how to had a kid you know what is this like and we have so much land that

► 01:11:51
this can be created and then spread across the world to orphanages in Africa and in China and just across the globe to create these environments that when there's expecting families moms and fathers that they feel like there's a place even if they don't feel well off enough to bring another life into this world that there's a place to go there's a plan a because

► 01:12:19
Plan B and Planned Parenthood were planned by a Eugenics that set out and said out loud I'm doing this to kill the black race and to create population control you know if we even know what he's saying Plan B mean the pill meaning the the the morning-after pill you know what let me Planned Parenthood let me let me let me decouple those things let me let me talk about Planned Parenthood okay

► 01:12:49
there's the last figure I saw is there were two hundred and ten thousand deaths due to covid in America and everywhere you go you see someone with a mask on

► 01:13:03
with a the a word a culture

► 01:13:09
I'll say it one time with abortion culture

► 01:13:13
there are

► 01:13:15
1,000 black children aborted

► 01:13:20
add a daily we are in genocide we

► 01:13:28
so more black children have died

► 01:13:32
in the past since February then people have died of covid and everyone wears a mask so it's a matter of where we turning a blind eye to like the media can control a lot of times it has control what we care about I even heard somebody say at one point this is the actual sentence I heard someone say Puerto Rico so played out meaning there was a time where people were caring about it and now the media says don't care about it but these people it still

► 01:14:02
I've been solved the hurricane still hit the earthquakes still hidden people are still suffering from that and no one has really gone to fix it and when that 11 billion goes to Haiti and it doesn't get to the people

► 01:14:16
you know the Daily Mail post a swimsuit pick or something and just deters our energy to what we have to do collectively to to to help our brothers and sisters you know I look at society as one body I want to just go into this riff because my thoughts are like these clouds and Mario Brothers and I'll jump to this and I'll see you another one I'll jump to another and say oh yes I jump to another

► 01:14:46
I need to express this this story I believe that

► 01:14:52
you know love will heal all and we have to look at I believe I believe that world peace is possible and I believe it's us looking at each other as

► 01:15:06
a moment in time time is love you love the things you put time into that's what I meant time is low like because this is like this intangible thing this thing you can't grab you can't just grab time in your hand you can't grab loving your hand but but we feel both of these things are real for us to love one another just as simple as that like Love Will Heal the World this is what it's going to take to heal the world but we have a competitive

► 01:15:36
you're it we like having a bad guy we like having a competitor so what we need to do is change the bad guy change the competitor make the competitor be the Roman era the Roman civilization make the competitive be the Egyptian Kingdom and say we are the first Society where the first civilization

► 01:16:01
that ever became civil because we are still just as much in the Dark Ages as medieval times or as Game of Thrones you know level Black Mirror level I know I went past future other dimension for a second but we kill each other we kill each other on social media we kill each other and high schools like in the way with that we talk to each other we physically kill each

► 01:16:31
they're in our own neighborhoods and outside of neighborhoods you know this planet when we when we keep turning a blind eye to our brothers and our sisters and our family which is us as a whole as all of humanity then of course it's going to get to the point where there's you know homeless sleeping under you know a bridge in Calabasas because we ignored the homeless person

► 01:17:00
I'm sleeping in front of the Gucci store

► 01:17:03
how do you houses just look at that visual it's a homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store we have Builders we have people who know how to make communities we have people who know how to cook and how to make food and how to

► 01:17:23
how to bring this food people are fighting over land and not really realizing that we're not we're not maximizing our resources and our existence we've got genius level scientists we've got people who Rogue you know people who have broken out of the chains like Elon like imagine of Elon was working at GM on the third floor somewhere you know we wouldn't have electric cars

► 01:17:51
wouldn't have that new Porsche hybrid wouldn't have what's happening with you know hyperloop imagine if the guy that in a started Airbnb was shut down or the guys who started Uber we're shut down all of these people who break away and then create the new society and the next Frontier of where we're going people like I've said like it feels to me like MIT is a place that

► 01:18:20
has to be funded by people who want to take the smartest people on the planet and make them work on the smallest things that won't change anything and I've talked to people from MIT and I could look at these brilliant Like This brilliant person I was talking from MIT and he was he was afraid Everything Was Fear everything was about his girlfriend's pregnant and you know we just got a house and I don't want to do anything to change this and and this is like one of the most

► 01:18:51
brilliant people on the planet but if you mix Brilliance with bravery that we can ignite something even this conversation alone can ignite the people that are going to change the world because there's people who have been anointed you can't teach the Brilliance and the anointed people who hit the game of life and they've got something that they're going to do no matter what school they go to they know Duty they just know how to do it they knew how to do it before they got here and they were going to do it and

► 01:19:20
and these people just need to see what it looks like to overcome the smokescreens of public humiliation of bankruptcy I was in debt the fear of loss I lost my mom or the fear of death you know what other fears are there there's a lot of fears but the thing is when you remove like even in the schools you remove prayer your move guy you remove

► 01:19:49
the fear God you create the possibility of the fear of everything else but watch this if you

► 01:19:59
instill the fear of God you eliminate the fear of anything else and it's not that I am fear less I am

► 01:20:14
definitely literally definitely shaking and in so much fear of my father I Fear God and I don't fear nothing else

► 01:20:29
disempower to that right like it just has a mental management tool there's some real power to that because so many people are afraid of every single little aspect of life bills and debt and love and relationships and if you have a higher power and this is one of the things that I've always wished to make what's the main word that you use even for fear this is the main disease that that people use in politics is to main fear is it but it's a main word is the disease

► 01:20:58
the world because it destroys your it changes your posture it change your idea it's worry yeah worry yeah xiety that's that's what is stress like it can kill you you can't be free you can't free to take chances to be worried about stuff like and Ice yeah so to be able to Anchor and eliminate worry and say this I am walking in a righteous path and I don't have to worry about anything I don't have to worry about going to jail I don't worry

► 01:21:28
about me killing them to worry about bankruptcy I don't have to worry about you know humiliation you know because this comes this is where smart-aleck prayers can get you I used to have this really smart aleck prayer I said God deliver me from pain

► 01:21:47
and then he took my mom

► 01:21:52
so it's hard to hurt that much hmm ever again

► 01:21:57
and create it almost like a character like Deadpool I'm like Deadpool for God

► 01:22:05
like there's no noise there's no human noise taken and you know someone tried to like there was there was a friend of mine that did like a really bad move where he tried to say I was using this this this lawyer and I was about to work with him and he said the lawyer said he wouldn't work with you until you get my contract done and I was just like I have you do not know me at all I would be the type to cut off my if I'm if my hands are they

► 01:22:35
how color my own hand I come back in the room they like yo what you doing here I thought we tied you up I'm like and then I go just make like a Luke Skywalker you know you know hand and this is one thing I want to say like and this is about to make me mad right here the first time you see me back get mad in the interview they said that George Lucas's prequels are worse than the corporate made Disney Star Wars I'll get mad at that to lie

► 01:23:05
like that's fucking ridiculous Revenge of the Sith we saw how Darth Vader was made yeah like I've watched that like 10 times during the covid don't jump in a kid I got The High Ground there's only movies were pure yeah we're pure that I'm no no I'm saying even the prequels are better than anything that and I'm sorry Disney Star Wars design team I know you're going to like put my face up in the you know office and be like forget

► 01:23:35
no man this is George this is his baby that thing was set in his heart to show us as children the hero's journey you know and these these like how can we run it back and replay like even at Disney you know there's there's people you know at Pixar that have left people have left you know where they call I've got the exact title but saying like every time as a new idea they called like

► 01:24:05
an unproven idea so they'll get to Toy Story 800,000 and Frozen trillion before there's a New Concept to the took a chance on yeah you take a chance and we've been we've been programmed like when you see the you know the homes the style of homes that I've been developing their far closer to the way the Galaxy looks the way water looks the way our makeup in our body feels we've been we've been put into these

► 01:24:35
boxes and that was you know due to money they did a construction that we have to be in these these boxes and we've been stuck in a loop like on West world and so now I feel like 10 G Newton no West world where she had to use the people that enslaved her that trapped her to make it to make it out you know the and it's funny when I like the box and what I'm talking about farming I had a point about farming that in finish earlier I hired this guy to do the A to Z concept I made it

► 01:25:05
plain as day make it so everything we cook in the kitchen at the school we planted here and they would just do it to 70% they do it to 60% earlier when I had that point I went to this whole riff about children need to learn physics and children lean to learn how to really do things and not having the separated thing like we are programmed to lock ourselves in a box and what's amazing right now is

► 01:25:33
the opportunity in the platform that we have that the world is hurting for everyone for those that are in power for those that are inside the program even those that are in power are still a part of the program and you know as I read this this tweet that someone say I finish watching Netflix what's next and that's so true that

► 01:26:02
we can't even program enough to satisfy ourselves the program is done Forrest Gump has stopped running and just turned around it's like all of this thing is a setup the the the concerts that musicians go to where we don't you know we're not thinking about the fact that we're not getting the Lion's Share of our masters because we're making the money on tour and then tour has girls and tour has the arena

► 01:26:30
singing your song and I need you right now did you do good champ you know like with Floyd Mayweather is is such a hero of mine and so excellent because he is a champion right but then also he wasn't afraid to say I do my deals I make my money and what I like is you know he didn't let the older

► 01:26:58
mmm tell him how to spend his money or how to show his money it was up to him because he's the he's his own King you know God is the king of us all but he's his own king and a lot of times in America we haven't seen we haven't seen Kings we haven't seen the the the royal blood in our bone marrow and the way it comes through now we could show it in and wrap in the way you put our chains on the way we dress we could show in the way we play ball and things like that but it's

► 01:27:28
the frontier to Bing to being a king well there's also something where you feel diminished in the fact that you know that your money is being stolen by people that don't deserve it so if you have some record Executives if you have some people that you know have looped you in to a fucked-up deal and they're making millions while you're making thousands that fucks with your head okay it just does makes you worry and stress gives me anxiety anxiety it eats at you it could drive you crazy I could drive

► 01:27:58
you crazy yeah so I still don't understand how they talked you into medication man I wish I knew you better back then because I would have just had to exercise I would add yeah I would say so what whatever he's doing you can't do like you have to understand that it's different people have different amounts of energy they have you have this ability to have these like really all-encompassing thoughts where you have these long

► 01:28:28
trains of ideas and thoughts in your head and you're implementing them this is all good this is this is a powerful thing I don't think it's a negative thing at all I mean some of it comes to you know I'm dealing with issues that are not just you know black and racial issues I'm dealing with Maverick you know innovator issues yeah I'm dealing with you know just as many you know issues where there's wall

► 01:28:58
of you know invisible walls and invisible chains as you know Michael Jackson dealt with as a black musician or Urban musician where he had to go and all Urban and came with Thriller he's like I let me go get this person who directed which is a Eastwick to I'm gonna get a movie director and he change you know movies forever I'm dealing with some some walls that you know people have done to hold back agents of change throughout history you know

► 01:29:28
no it's like the movie is here like this part you know I was talking right now maybe a scene from my life's movie like Tesla was you know a white guy that was a ladies man and he would be going to all the like fancy events and everything and he stopped having sex at age 40 and said you know I'm going to focus on it and and I mean he died he died penniless at the end you know I'm not

► 01:29:58
to say like he turned evil but he's trying to sell a bomb and he had all these like answers that would change the construct a society and I my best example is like code Act is there in a place where they can barely pull it together now but they invented the digital camera and they didn't bring it to Market because because

► 01:30:25
they had all this film to sell but one of the things that's really you know that's a challenge for me is you know I designed this thing this we call it the foam Runner and we built a factory for it and Cody and you can make these in 25 minutes and what I'm saying about design I was talking to one of the just awesome designers that we just got over a Yeezy we got like this

► 01:30:52
amazing crew we got guys that Nike sued us for and one of these guys I was trying to hire him for two years he had had an okapi had to go surf for a year and now he's in and when he like you know does his CAD drawings it's almost like one shot one kill you know sometimes you design stuff you got to do it like 5/8 times like his first one is so close to being ready to go to market because he sketches in a certain kind of way and for the longest we said you know let's

► 01:31:23
I'm saying I want to get rid of laces and we still have shoes we sell with laces because it's a popular shoe and people love this shoe and it it hurts me I feel like Steve Jobs trying to like remove buttons off the side of the next apple and one of the things that's interesting about this if you look at most sneakers if you look at you guys sneakers right now you have a tongue you know and it goes this direction this is one of the Innovations about this is one reason why this is one of the most important sneaker designs

► 01:31:52
is this goes this way because it's ergonomic and I remember putting it on and being uncomfortable with wearing it because I'm so used to like the way like a Jordan or something fits with my jeans that I remember talking to Kobe and him talking about having to make sneakers that fit with jeans and that was a big thing because you know that's what we grow up we go wherever you know Karl Kani jeans and Jordans or something like that so this also I filled that

► 01:32:22
just the process when I design I become like a three-year-old I have to go to my gut I have to forget everything I know and really focus in to what I feel like some straight Jedi Yoda or like you know if I can grab that water bottle or like like would have been cool if I just did it right now should I had a magnet under that you've liked him like yo this dude is a wizard so so so for me you know I I'm going to make this

► 01:32:52
you be $20 and you know money isn't real so that means the world should be eventually free so I'm going to manifest the world being free my dad he lives in a Dr he says you know anything that you put in the ground grows so why do people still go hungry and I like that in theory but I was like man farming is really hard though man I think you know I might go hungry if I have someone to fuck this with this like but you know

► 01:33:22
no back in the days we had that skill set now we're losing these skill sets that actually we can sustain off of so with this and I love giving you guys my riffs I'm like a human version of Instagram when you look at Instagram you look at you know you're looking like a hundred images a day well I've got millions of images in my mind and the majority of them have it

► 01:33:51
been realized yet you know there's some images that are from my memory but I got this whole the future that's in my mind that has to be brought so this is you know we talked about hype culture and choose being sold on the you know the resale market and Yeezy lives in that place but you know I don't like the idea I don't love the idea that some of the reason why people buy it is just

► 01:34:19
for hype culture or you ain't got this so I got this colorway and you don't have it that type of mentality I'm in his I'm an essentialist I'm a minimalist and like I have to I will bring the the fully A to Z our existence version to existence like Victor Gruen designed the shopping centers but he designed full utopian communities and people were like we're just cool with the shop

► 01:34:49
being Center that's all we want and these ideas that he had never got brought to fruition a little bit like Disney kind of Base Epcot Center on like on Victor growing but these this next Frontier of these communities and Villages of Happiness are way closer to a Kenyan Village than it is to a like a gated community Village but one of the things about your this version 2 hype culture one of the good things about the hype culture

► 01:35:19
ER is if people get into your products they're going to get into you and they'll get to get into your ideas and all these ideas that you have will become a part of their thought process they'll start thinking about it they go hey he's got some great points if people really get into your shit they're also really going to get into your ideas I think it's one of the things that make people uncomfortable about you because you have the courage to have all these bold ideas and to implement them and to do all these different things that bothers people and there's a lot of people

► 01:35:49
don't have that kind of courage and they are straddle down by anxiety and they see a guy like you and they'll try to find flaws they try to find things that are wrong with it instead of looking at the positive aspects of it the only concentrate on the negative aspects of it I don't think I don't see it that way I've never saw it that way I look you look at that guy fuck it do anything there's people like Tesla and there's people who yeah there's a person who killed animals with Tessa course to make people not like Tesla the person citizen yeah

► 01:36:19
person made the electric chair be made with the test of course of so people wouldn't like Tesla Tesla still has inventions that haven't been brought to our society that would have brought more Simplicity and happiness to our society like the Westinghouse ability to transmit electricity through the air which is fascinating I don't know if that would have worked in today's world with cell phones and all the different electronics and even you know modern air travel I don't know I don't know what if it would have worked but things would have been different

► 01:36:49
our over-designing into Industries where they see they can make some money as opposed to stepping back and saying how do we look at the entire Earth as an opportunity to free everyone and create happiness for for everyone so like only a there's only a billion people on the internet you never think about that the 7 to 8 billion people on Earth but then there's only a billion people that are influence and that

► 01:37:19
are on the internet we feel like the internet is everything is only like 15 you know 618 percent of human beings but in order to make for our civilization for us to survive we have to make more human beings we have we have family we have to we have to have food we have to have shelter that we don't have to have the internet we don't have to have music we don't have to have you know that that's a conversation I

► 01:37:50
I mean it enhances life yeah and enhances the quality of life is better but look at the music look look at look at what the information we're we're putting in it like I feel bad when I hear rap songs I feel bad even the stuff that you know I just recently put out I was like you know how you listen to lames they did imitation man likewise that's just I don't like that message because we're all the imitation

► 01:38:19
of our parents and imitation this invitation and then imitation Adam and Eve you know we're and we're we're all the next versions it should be the V2 V3 V4 like you know Michelangelo and DaVinci had the same teacher you know there's times where you know my like people work with me or if you say like my mentees or whatever will go out and they'll do something that I wanted to do and then I'm torn because as a man

► 01:38:49
you know I'm jealous and I'm proud at the same time and it's like a father-son relationship because sometimes when the when the Sun goes out and is more successful at things the father wants to say that's a good job but every time the sun does something as a good job reminds the father of his failures yes so it was just I mean it's a it's a it's a strong Dynamic that that's where I have to lean on God to not be like

► 01:39:19
you know this dislike prick that's jealous of you know people who are innovating or taking you know the goal line because we got to realize we're in a relay race of humanity at a certain point whoever you know what what the inventors in the in the past it is now handed over to the inventor's today that had handed over to the next vendors with the good thing about the walls and the perception and all that is

► 01:39:49
it's like smaller barrier to entry allows there to be you know a Walt Disney and a Steve Jobs and a Henry Ford so what I'm doing right now there's a there's a there's a real barrier to entry to doing to constructing homes and communities and farm like you can't you can't just do it like how you can just you know it's hard for someone to go from I'm not saying it can't happen I'm just saying that it's difficult

► 01:40:19
kle for someone to go from you know programming and putting their music out on the internet today to what it was that Michael Jackson had to do that Barry entry was so hard for him that means since he this guy was the leader of the Jackson 5 when he was five like his entire life led up and this is what he focused on and it made and it was all focused on that so it may the great Michael Jackson now I want to do this comparison of Disney Steve and a Henry Ford and

► 01:40:49
what Yeezy is

► 01:40:53
it's really hard to make houses it's like a corrupt industry also you got Contra how many times have you started on a house and contractors like start overcharging for stuff and the budget ends up being twice the amount and it's twice as long look if you had a relationship this is why really relationships are better currency than than than money if you had a relationship with the contractors if you were part of their family your house would be done quick I feel like it's a

► 01:41:22
good joke on rich people how long houses take to Bill I was in the airport and there was a first-class line that was super slow and there was a coach area with like eight openings and there was no one in it and then I hopped out and this other gentleman hopped out with me and went to that line and we went through but the rich people with the Hermes belts didn't want to lose their position so bad that they would rather wait in the first class line then to have the time

► 01:41:52
I'm back and go through that now this gentleman is a surgeon that works on people's hearts through their feet so it's like that kind of Engineers serger doctor mentalities like yeah I got money because this this is what I'm doing but I'm here to serve and I have a mentality that I'm not better than the person that's in coach which is the reason why we were the only two that went through that how do you Segway off of this one I just go into this like how do you even find a question what

► 01:42:22
what do you think it over there that there's no witness yeah there's no reason to worry about it yeah you you have this thought you have a rigid process that you organize your day with like how do you you you seem to have so many different thoughts so many different things going on simultaneously like how do you how do you organize your day

► 01:42:43
do you have like ritual do you have and I drive my children to school drive my kids to school and I stay at school with them all day and you know I'm in the kitchen like working with the top chefs on the planet to create this you know these healthy menus and I'm working with the farmers so the school

► 01:43:14
that I'm at is also it's like this new I don't want no disrespect to NASA was going to say new NASA but of humanity that were anchoring it around our children so that's what my day consists of but then I also in the past couple months have been going to Atlanta for two days a week or three days a week because I'm building this

► 01:43:43
mm oh I'm not supposed to say that I'm building we're gonna Sound Stage but and but it was funny because I go back and forth on content should I work in content should I work in Tech I have all these like website ideas and Tech ideas and I sometimes I was like I'll see you I'm cursed by Tech like I'm not you know I don't have any curses or God has had lets me break the curses and break the

► 01:44:13
chains I rather say I don't know if content is my calling like messaging like let me show you what a School of the Future looks like let me show you a monasteries of the future let me show you the Farms of the future look like but we 20 years past the future like it's in 2020 like we're supposed to be in the future by mm so it's my job to pull the future and to now and that's something I struggle with when I talk about the different things that I'm doing getting into the idea of doing

► 01:44:43
like content for Netflix or content for Hulu and like what that content because I believe we're in the movie I believe we're in the game we're in like Grand Theft Auto was just too many things that align and we're not we can terraform what we can do is be like if your Grand Theft Auto character just started redesigning the world his self like painting his own his own world we have this opportunity to make life as fun as the

► 01:45:13
life's but if you look at how politics politics just general unhappiness misery control the speed that contractors go the farmers that wouldn't finish the farm the way we are with each other is why people feel like look everyone's going to go into like this ready player one second life and I believe that our first life can be just as imaginative and it will be so that's my and I have a bunch of friends that work in the gaming

► 01:45:43
the street and I have friends that work in the content industry and I'm saying I'm anchoring on real life to make real life as awesome as games to make real life as awesome as a movies so did I answer the question of my schedule every day yeah but you mean you so you just basically go on what you feel like working on you basically just start your day you you do your stuff with your kids and then whatever these ideas you have

► 01:46:13
if you just nourish them you just encourage them you just you just feed whatever thoughts are in your head well I yeah but what I was expressing on that on that last Symphony I gave you was this was that I do have this challenge that's where I'm designing I'm does I'm actually designing what I'm doing with my time saying

► 01:46:41
should I be even taking a meeting like when I take a meeting this is how I know if it's a good or bad meeting if someone's talking to me and I just get sleepy I know that that's not what I should do but if someone's talking them you know energized I like saying the word energized over the word excited because this is what they do to this is what they do to all of us need to get us excited and anxiety kind of go together like someone could say hey I got you a new car and it's across the street you can sew

► 01:47:11
side of you run across the street get hit by a car trying to run to your new but if you're energized about having the car perhaps you look both ways so I play this dictionary game with the like this this small Webster pocket dictionary and we will go to a page and say go to page the word help on it and we say highlight all the words you think are positive and then we talk about afterwards why do you think that's positive so the word help is like it's like a

► 01:47:40
it's like a bad leg on a table you think you could stand on it but if you stand right there that table could flip over the fourth definition in the word help is to ignore and it actually makes sense you know all like if you have a meeting right here's the answer when you know the meeting didn't go do good I didn't go well the person says that they know how can I help that means they don't want to do nothing there's his give you a phone number you know the word is to ensure and then there's a lot of

► 01:48:09
words that end with you re that are very powerful future sure pure endure and that goes into like the right because I'm literally trying to figure out the video game at all times let's see where these things parallel I know this can get into like a riff or people like okay yeah you were losing what you're saying right now but but look at that look at the dictionary look at these words I have friends that English is their second and third

► 01:48:38
or a flag which and they say the English is the hardest language to learn because it's so many words to that mean the same thing it like it tears me to my core that my daughter has to learn T wo the difference between wot 000 and Tio I want to just be like just draw the number two I just make it like I sometimes I don't know when you know the difference I'm like a terrible speller and I believe that there's like curriculums that are that are

► 01:49:09
European curriculums that don't even apply to our genes you know who we are as a people like African descent people we don't even talk like that like this is a skill set but I'm still talking white basically like you'll see like a black Pastor you know give this amazing like sermon or like marry someone I was at a wedding and this guy they said well I speak so well what do you mean well he speaks super white like what yeah that's what the definition of whale

► 01:49:38
yeah right right it just sounds using to communicate ideas right yeah well this funny I bumped it to a friend of mine actually Matt Williams this at a Giovanni I wasn't expecting to see I wasn't expecting expecting to see him I wasn't expecting to see him and we're at the Mercer Lobby and he caught me off guard and I was like

► 01:50:03
I didn't use words when I when I when I saw I liked almost communicated in a different language like a language like Joy or happiness only 30% of our communication is is verbal that's why the mask just really throw me off because I can't tell what someone is thinking and feeling because a lot of times 1/2 times people don't say what they're thinking and feeling and I have to decode with the mask I can only

► 01:50:32
hear what they're saying that's the problem with social media to right yes things are black and white and things being taken out of context I mean that's the reason why people like you know love this show that they're like oh we got the yay Joe Rogan we can hear him go into all of these Rifts yeah and we can feel them you could see you know how I'm looking you can see my energy and the way I'm saying it to ya so and what and you see people sitting down having an actual conversation a real conversation yeah

► 01:51:02
and a conversation where anybody that comes on this show you don't have like this like sometimes with reporters they have like a people that are immediate they have like a complex you don't have a complex you'd like yo let's first solve to get this straight like if I like I could whip your ass I'm Joe Rogan I'm a professional fighter now let's start the conversation which I think is another reason like with Nick Cannon he's like man I marry Mariah Carey I did all these and both of these interviews have been very positive

► 01:51:32
because people aren't carrying something already like some form of chip on their shoulder where they got a like at every sentence sometimes I talk to reporters it's like they're saying the thing they wanted to say to this guy in high school that they never got to complete the conversation and they're taking it out on me I'm like yeah I think there's a lot of people that have conversations with people and they want to create a viral moment to that it's not just a conversation they

► 01:52:02
have an agenda it's on it's almost like you were talking about the Disney Star Wars movies that then it's not a work of art it's a formula like two plus two is four let's put those together we'll make some money instead of the original Star Wars which was the hero's journey which was like a Joseph Campbell book it's like there was a beauty and a purity to it it's an expression like someone comes up with an idea and they bring it to fruition and then you get to watch and you like wow it moves you the new

► 01:52:32
he's done move you and it was a crew of of leaders of thought leaders that like I was is it Brian De Palma that told George to put the words at the beginning because it's like you really all I've been feeling like it's like when I talk up to this point I just been making THX you know and then the toys from Star Wars have not come out first which would be like you know like the Yeezys or something like that and now it's time making

► 01:53:02
in the whole Star Wars in real life like backwards like the product came first kind of like Disney like Disney he was Mickey Mouse became super popular before he was able to get all of his imagineers imagineers in I want to point out you know when people talk about being you know self-absorbed or the center of your own Universe what's the main character in Star Wars name

► 01:53:29
Luke Skywalker who created Star Wars George Lucas

► 01:53:36
but did he write it but listen to that last name yeah that's yeah George Luke yes yeah he's the main character in Star Wars he cased ancestor that's it was awesome yeah there's just something about things that are pure right versus things that are attempting to recreate new something that people are going to like there's there's a

► 01:54:06
rinse and the Z it's in music as well right like your music resonates with people because it's obviously coming from your mind whereas some people are creating songs that they think are going to be hits the creating top 40 it's coming from my heart and my gut but when it's the most pure it's coming from God and I'm being used as a channel it's like when Tonya Harding hit the the triple flip you know she had all that skill and then some point it's not called a trip is goes

► 01:54:36
cause I'm about to say triple triple Lindy like is rajee Right Rodney Dangerfield this up but it's like it's these moments where we do things that are seem like Superhero level and I think that's what M Night Shyamalan was laying out for us with unbreakable glass and what was the other one with the guy with the multiple personalities it's like he's got three of these films that are like showing us hey your superheroes

► 01:55:06
you can believe it the greatest disabler of our of our abilities our greatest our greatest Kryptonite is doubt right you know and fear yeah doubt like why did I you know like going to why did I register so late to run for president covid like I remember like I had I had the virus and I was sitting

► 01:55:36
you know quarantine and my house and my cousin text me about being prepared to run for president and I just completely pull like put it off to the side because I was like shivering and you know having a shakes to take it hot showers and eating soup and you know just flipping have it I don't think it was that bad I think it was a Mau case and it just threw off I mean through everyone off at through

► 01:56:06
his plans off and then you know it was just this calling on my heart and I remember talking to like really like elitist you know writers you know I was trying to avoid saying white supremacist but like Elite like the the liberal Elites are like

► 01:56:26
you know so Boy Who you gonna vote out you know like who are you to run for office and why would you sign up for office you know if you if you can't even get on ballots that's people are saying that to me and I could get on the ballot it's like there's black mothers that go into hospital and the doctor will tell him that there's something wrong with their child or get them to this is happening to this date and then when people said you know are you

► 01:56:56
are you a pawn like for the Republicans

► 01:57:02
the reason why I think that people are asking me that is because because the Democrats do create black pawns they do have celebrities that they'll sit down and meet with and say you're going to be an advocate for the Democratic party and you know everyone's like you know and I'm not trying to take any sides of like Republicans Or democrats I'm just saying why we're why are people so much thinking that I was like a form of pain and then the eye

► 01:57:31
dear that you know Liberals are say like the funny thing is liberals I think and I'm I don't know if I could classify myself as their boo but I'm definitely kind of liberal Elite I wrote My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy like I've had some of the best writing so that would put me in that class so to say but I'm also just a purist like I see a Kenyan home and be like that's beautiful right there I'm not like I got

► 01:58:01
I have the so the one of the most racist things that liberals who Pride themselves on that being racist have said to me is like you're going to split the black vote and that makes it seem like black people can't make decisions for ourselves and that don't know white people know me like I'm on like only the liberal they literally make it seem like only black people will vote for me right think about that statement the the nuance

► 01:58:32
of institutionalized racism and this would be like somebody from the art world you know I mean and they just have a place where no one has really been able to embrace the idea of blacks not being in a block and staying in one place or blacks having to vote Democrat yeah or blacks have an opinion like us not being on boards or us being like handlers for other black people meaning like

► 01:59:01
if we work at a label we work at a big Corporation it's our job to go talk to the other black people you know to calm other black people down but we're working for you no Universal or vivendi or whatever the organization is where you know I was thinking about buying my masters and I realized that that was too small of a thought I'm going to buy Universal

► 01:59:30
the only a thirty three billion dollar organization I'm one of the greatest product producers that ever existed I'm a child I'm 43 years old I was 53 million dollars in debt you know four years ago and now it's proven that I'm the new Michael Jordan of products I went to Adidas and we were 15 billion dollar organization losing 2 billion before covid hit while Market

► 02:00:00
was 68 billion I went to the Gap and our partner with The Gap and our stock jumped 45% and two hours the organization made two billion dollars and two out and two hours and now we've double we I mean the Gap was Mark cap was lower than Yeezy it was like 3 billion dollars when I first got the now it's like seven eight billion dollars and we haven't even released

► 02:00:30
just a product yet but what I loved I you know I sat there and I did the deal without getting on the board and I looked at my cousin and I didn't want to sign the deal without being on the board and I looked at him I said I'm doing this for you meaning like this is part of a relay race it would just be a given that if someone of color was to your position of my position of influence will be on the board but Michael Jordan had to break down walls and Michael Jackson had to break down walls for

► 02:01:00
us to break down the next walls and the next walls are the boardroom because you know what the boardroom is it's an opinion see people are fine for us to play basketball and you know wrap and make clothes but the society is the setup is not really used to her fine with us actually have an opinion and I can understand why because what is our opinion based on if we grew up thinking we were slaves

► 02:01:30
is if our opinion isn't based on hey my dad taught me how to run this company you know my dad is smarter than me and everything he wanted to do black people thought he was crazy and he had to do it with white people who thought he was incompetent because he was black and the way these companies and the way the music industry the way managers and the way Society generally looks at black people is the way like a massage

► 02:02:00
Gina stick man looks at a hot lady hmm what can you give me what can you do for me no one the misogynistic man acting like a hot lady and say can you run my company

► 02:02:13
so you know this idea of me you know and I got like I'm building my factories of the simplified to design and I was working with a guy that you know that's helping me to you know build some of the factories it was an older white gentleman and he just matter-of-factly says we're sitting at his house in Malibu it's a nice day just matter-of-factly says Adidas will never put you on the board

► 02:02:40
and I'm like this this wall has to come down like how could you not have the guy that has the best idea so one of the great things with universal one of the approaches that we have is you know Universal and Jimmy Iovine and dr. Dre so Beats by Dre Universal had a chance to buy in and do different things they sold it for three billion dollars that was half of the value of University the time of 6 billion due to the internet

► 02:03:10
the music industry was afraid of in 2000 Universal now I think is a were 33 built 35 billion dollars and now they have another Steve Jobs you know Howard Hughes Henry Ford Disney Ilan kind of character within their mitts but they're so concerned about the control of the idea of

► 02:03:39
that's because they're using me as like this artist that has attracted other artists also I used them I got famous made some money I got to tour you know became this Superstar so we use each other now there's it just an adjustment that needs to be made in the relationship and I can make and I will make products that will make more money than Universal is worth but it's not about the money as I said earlier it's about the fact that even though

► 02:04:10
my net worth is five billion dollars and I'm one of the most famous most influential God-fearing Christians on the planet the

► 02:04:19
I still have to go to this man or this organization and ask him for something and that is what is about you can have a company right when you go and do your company's don't think because you got the most ownership that you actually have the control if you don't have the information and the knowledge of how the distribution works and you're not having that conversation you don't have the control so what I did in my organization with universal with gap and with Adidas I told my lawyers my managers everything no one

► 02:04:49
communicate but these organizations except for me you can give me advice but they got to talk to the boss which is me and right there you start to get the information flow I guess who's my CFO who me so that means I do have the time I do this 10 to 15 transactions what I do is I pay because I had open credit cards I had checks you know

► 02:05:19
I had people flying in and out I had a consultant agreements like people who weren't on the salary but they were Consultants I had you know people paying for flights hotels cars food Netflix like everything just running the account just even right now I cancel all my credit cards except for one credit card this is like the Oprah Winfrey moment where she's like man when I started spending cash I was like I really realized you know

► 02:05:49
I was spinning and I'm sign all my own checks and the thing that happens in the music industry is just a lot of industries that people tell you that someone needs to do something for you and it's like look this Serie do everything for you know you can do that it's possible and it's just when you asked me how do I delegate my time it's important for me to delegate my time if I made two hundred ten million dollars last year and yeah I have a lot of Maverick ideas I'm working on cities and homeless shelters and farms and I'm reinvesting myself so a lot of

► 02:06:19
Mavericks will you know spend their money on their ideas and they'll invest and what they see the future is and I ended up with a net worth of 10 million I remember you know few a month ago people were like you can't show your taxes because people won't understand that you're a billionaire if they see that you only net it 10 million last year and after the Gap deal happened my net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion and

► 02:06:49
been asking the people around me to run the story and they were going to run it with Bloomberg they never ran it I was not afraid of people looking at me like I was not a billionaire and I said be honest show my taxes show everything and then the reports came back oh you're worth five billion it came from me just being honest when I want to say something about the Gap deal also in specifically the name the Gap in my my journey with that like at age 16 I worked at the Gap out

► 02:07:19
we saw the Gap as like being the apple of apparel always had this comparison with seizures I always felt like I was the Steve Jobs of the Gap if somebody how clean it was and what Mickey Drexler done all these commercials and like you know at age 16 I was working at the Gap and I got fired for stealing and I was actually still in khakis I was still in khakis from our friend funny thing look I stole khakis for my friend when I started doing music at age 19 18

► 02:07:49
I went and bought a chain I came home one day didn't see with the chain was come to find out my friend was smoking crack at it stole my chain so the guy I was stealing for end up stealing from me but it's khakis I was telling some GAP khakis I wanted those khakis that bad so then 27 years later you know I give my life to God and I start doing Sunday service one of the things that I

► 02:08:19
I had to do for Sunday service I got to do that was fun for me to do was to design the Wardrobe for Sunday service and we would redesign t-shirts and it says in the Bible that Jesus wore a seamless garment so we started building t-shirts with the scene was only here only two seams on the shirt or moving it around with the necklace and I made t-shirt after t-shirt after t-shirt and Christianity we say we stand in the Gap so watch this

► 02:08:46
this opportunity is presented and I always had clothes that were kind of chill like they could be at the Gap they were not overly fashionable and God said you you you stood in the gap

► 02:08:59
and I'm gonna have you stand in the gap for real and I'm going to give you favor an increase and I know / some person I know somebody were all that designing t-shirts would come in handy I literally was designing t-shirts for Sunday service like David working out in the field tending to the field you know and Goliath came they wanted one of his brothers in the Warriors to to go up against Goliath and his father chose David and David's I don't need all this armor I just need these three smooth stones

► 02:09:28
just need you know this is how I got to see they didn't know David had had to fight a lion and had to fight a bear so God by him tending to the fill and humility and in service to God and honor to his family he was able to have the skill set to take down Goliath we hit the street you know it's a term that I had to learn Wall Street we hit the street like you never ever saw it before I used to be in San Fran asking people to

► 02:09:58
Esta me nobody invested me when I went to a wedding in San Fran with all these billionaires and investors Angel Investors you should have seen people's faces they were like you jump from the three-point line you ran a stock by 45% you see think about this you're going to split the black vote you can't vote for the you you're only a rapper you want to it's like all these things that diminish me yeah and now it's like Deadpool like I came back as like a superhero and I won't let that be the Kryptonite I won't let my

► 02:10:28
ego Be My Kryptonite I won't let other people's opinions Be My Kryptonite I won't let these labels that people put on Me Be My Kryptonite and a lot of times I don't like to watch these interviews back until about you know three four five years later because I'm always you know I'm visiting the now I'm existing in the future and visiting the now when I was speaking it to you and they make a lot more sense in the future because I can tell you but he can show you God shows us a lot of stuff I'm telling you and some

► 02:10:58
people are following me some people are believing in it and some people are just doubting it because they want to put this label all he's crazy or it's just a black guy saying it or it's just a rapper it's just a it's just an Entertainer it's just whatever it is so I can say the most wild ideas our lives like Veronica Corningstone wanting to be an anchor person and I remember she says yo Ron I told you I wanted to be and he said yes I heard you I wrote it down Veronica Corningstone had a very funny joke tonight

► 02:11:29
and every time I talk is what you're like Veronica Corningstone having a very funny joke tonight like when I say it's going to run for president that was like okay go ahead would you like to interject do you have thoughts and ideas also that you like to have be a part of your interview well you weren't friends you have from people mad at you leave splitting the back black vote all the way to the Gap and all the way to Veronica means but I then I brought it back you did to the vote to run a program started back from two people doubting you and people putting limitations on you people are

► 02:11:58
tune in this podcast that go on the journey with us yeah listen to do or they don't have to them yeah do you want the beautiful things you're not listening to these people these people that are trying to put these labels on you and tell you what to do and you're not saddled down by fear you're not saddled down by doubt you're willing to take these chances if you did become president what would you do that what's different

► 02:12:22
I mean pretty much everything I was just looking at the suits last night I was like yo who would you redesign I don't wear white anymore they had a white shirt you know they had a like a I just

► 02:12:39
I would I would redesign this I will it's not a wood and it's not an if is that if it's just when right we got to start with a budget I feel like you know the fact that I went from being in debt to to Van I don't even like the way it sounds the multi because we think about Steve Jobs is money is like the least of what's awesome about him

► 02:13:09
money is just a tool like it's like nails like I got the most nail feel like it's score on the scoreboard those it proves it proves not just value but it proves Effectiveness yeah and it's like you're crazy to your right so it proves in some way that a lot of the things I said they were crazy I was actually right about yeah looking at that budget and I think that that's part of God's like training like mr. Miyagi paint the fence you know Karate Kid Daniel son on that I gave like the full description of the

► 02:13:39
of the analogy does the case people didn't what do you think you would do though if they come to you with talks about foreign policy people love set talking about foreign policy that's the number one question but when I talked about the budget you know this paint the fence the fact that I had to you know that I have to understand 300 million dollars of cash a year that you don't get trained for that that's like Astronaut training that I have to understand

► 02:14:09
I have multiple industries that I have to understand how to build and house and provide you know I provide people with health care and I could have had this idea of doing a zero employee org where I put everything on my partners on universal on the gap on Adidas but I believe this is amazing training for me as a black person there's people who who who

► 02:14:39
I've been raised to respect a penny but as a black person I've been raised to look down at a penny but the people who really hold their money respect every penny they respect the money and it's interesting I had an argument with one of my managers because I made my own travel ban and my organization because you know I did when I did Sunday service a month and a half ago I was 25 flights coming in and people I didn't know because there's criminals in my organization trying to

► 02:15:09
heel Bob Marley not to JFK or MLK me but deplete my resources so I created this travel would explain that what you mean by that what I mean by what criminals in your organization like what do you mean meaning there's people that okay I fired this one CFO

► 02:15:28
about three months ago and up to a week ago he still had an open credit card because when I dig lower and Dick lower and go to it it's like always like is this the new person that's in charge of your money it's like no I'm the new person that's in charge of your money that's in charge of my money rather so so that's why you became your CFO that's how I became and it's the best and it's it clears my thoughts and it really helps me with design it helps me as I'm designing designing

► 02:15:58
what I'm doing at the Gap he tells me what I'm how I'm designing the curriculum it helps you in the way I'm designing the kitchen the way I'm delegating the way I'm working the way I am and being a better leader being a better being a better listener basic it but they were some question you had I had I was answered and I gave you all this before you went to foreign policies I went to the the budget why I said it's like Daniel some painting the fence the fact that I've had to really look at and understand that kind of money

► 02:16:27
any and this god-given anointing being a producer being ahead of Industry to be a God-fearing and God and a servant of God and a producer & head of Industry at the same time is literally like the perfect combination for a president and to be honest I'm literally like every now and then America has to get America deserves the world deserves a lead

► 02:16:57
sure that they can 100% trust that whatever I'm saying to you with the information that I have in front of me I 100% believe that like when I talked to the when I was with the president of Haiti and he gave us an island me and shervin picture of our that was early angel investor at Uber and is working on the Virgin hyperloop right now really great friend of mine

► 02:17:27
mine he saved me he's having a void deals where I was going to give up a percentage of my company for a third of the value and different things like that so we go to Haiti in the president gives us this island to develop to make a city of the future and also we're going to have the farmers and the people who live there take a percentage I mean take ownership of the land that they have right now so when it raises it valued they all eat off of what the

► 02:17:57
ideas but he said that

► 02:18:02
the way that he is done business with our president is so straightforward I believe that I know that me as president would be the best thing that ever happened for America's foreign policy I've travelled more than any president already and I bring people together I put rivals on songs together to create masterpieces I go and I empathize when I meet with leaders in Africa when I meet with leaders

► 02:18:32
in I didn't really have a good next thing I wanted to sound good it like name of the leaders in I wanted to sound fire but when see honesty so when I when I meet with when I meet with leaders I'm not trying to go in there and see how they can use my internet I'm not trying to go in there and buy up their land and develop it and buy it for cheap you know we're

► 02:19:02
going to share information you know we're you know we have an idea we just had a dual citizenship for Americans with African descent that the ability to create environments and communities completely can change the way people act you know if people are hungry they're going to act a certain way people have food they're going to have a certain way people are away from their friends and

► 02:19:32
and they're going to act a certain way they're going to need to add a college town they need to stop by this you know frat party and you know drink and do it but but when they're you know but you got to go here so then you could go there and like Society is all about dismantling the family I see things being more like a kibbutz or you know where the family can be as close and when the grandparents can be next to the children and you know these ideas I have about

► 02:19:59
out how communities should be our worldwide simplified ideas and that then that based on industry even though I understand industry they're based on serving God and serving families and that's something that everyone across the globe no matter what country in the world whatever continent and world all of the moms and dads have something in common they want the world to be better for their children we all want the world to be better for the children

► 02:20:30
and we can show ways that we are not at odds think about the world is a giant piano but we're playing off-key so for a producer to synthesize those ideas and not say okay we're going to shut that spent time in China I spent a year in China when I was in fifth grade I used to speak Chinese like Neo Marche need like I don't know a lot of yeah my mom was an English Professor they had Exchange program where a Chinese student could

► 02:20:59
come to America and she could go to which was there was like Chinese at that time couldn't come to America as as easily so

► 02:21:10
you know there's America's greatest export is influence and culture China actually has like imitation Paris imitation they probably got imitation Calabasas at this probably do at this point you know the artist Define culture that's what makes it was an artist that made the design the Statue of Liberty there's an artist that designed the Eiffel Tower

► 02:21:40
this is the reason why I donated a hundred million dollars to James Turrell is Roden crater project when I went to this is like the eighth wonder of the world but I saw spaces that we can exist in that would be helpful for our health our well-being these are healthier places for us to be we need to be like almost like to raelians like our life is like a Shakespearean scholar like Shakespeare's written 30

► 02:22:10
e % of our language that we use like I say like he must have been a really nice person like DaVinci used to walk away from people when he would talk to people and that's but that's the reason why it's The DaVinci Code and at The DaVinci life because he never was able to get it across to the to the to the level to affect us for generations to come these people love art but they want to put Art In The Box we need to surround ourselves with the artists because the artists are the most connected

► 02:22:40
the most truthful and their dinosaur never got killed somehow the people of figured out how to make a real a living off of art is what do you mean by the dinosaur never got killed meaning

► 02:22:55
art class would be considered to be fun like every kid loves to draw yeah right but some people got to grow up and like the artist run and some way don't have to yes like this step we're all children we're all if you're if you're alive you're a child we're all children and God's eyes and we're all young people like Jesus is a old birth like he's oh my you know like Adam is old you know if you're alive

► 02:23:25
you're you're young and were like children and there's all these things these sharp edges these Corners these anxieties these fears these things put in our food our diet our diet of what we consume right here that turn us old and make us bread oh and make us put that fear on our kids don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby I put that they put that we put these evils on our children put racism sure on our children put fear yeah on our children and the children are fearless

► 02:23:55
the children it's funny it's like Claudio Sylvester in one of our lead Architects that work with since age 24 he built this home in Mallorca with John Paulson and he has like this golf course which it's in the Acoustics are incredible but it's this part where you can walk along that's 20 feet high and I said you know would you you know what about the kids what you know you have a balcony I have a banister some and he looked at me said they're smarter than we think

► 02:24:25
wow and meaning like if we were never taught the missing banister theory that we could all tightrope walk hmm the missing banister Theory I wrote it in my book thank you and you're welcome that I wrote my friend Sakaya that's actually here right now that's that you're talking to earlier is look you could walk down a straight line without worrying about anything but you take that exact straight line and put a 20-story high 20 stories high have you know I'm going with it yeah and your move

► 02:24:55
the balconies you're going to be so concerned about the idea of falling that it will make you fall yep and that's where the superpower is in removing the fear yes that's a beautiful thing to say right there yeah and it's also probably the first sound biteable thing that I've said the entire let me talk to you about so we're serious here so let's talk about like real presidential issues let's talk about here's here's something

► 02:25:25
is that it just in when we talk about this country here's some things that are that mean a lot to me one student debt I think it's crazy I think it's crazy that we take children when they're 17 18 years old we sent away to college we make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and then we asked them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and and try to get a job that's going to pay them a fraction of what they owe for their education I think it's crazy I think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt I think we should figure out a way

► 02:25:55
a to make education at the very least far less expensive than it is now this is this is a big issue for people absolutely I'm completely confident that I will figure out how to get America out of debt that I have the ability once I see everything I never make the wrong decision

► 02:26:18
when I'm giving all the information that's my that's my skill set anything I go into producing rap homes clothing anything once I'm given the right information I apply my taste and I have the best taste on the planet I mean Quincy Jones is a couple people that's like okay it's quite a strong taste might be better than my but if Quincy could you imagine Quincy Jones as a president I could yeah Walt

► 02:26:47
a Steve Jobs like maybe maybe some of these personalities are volatile yeah but that's how he gets things done yeah like for America to be as warming and inviting as as Disney World there used to be you know this dream of you know people still have this dream of coming to him they come to America like it's the America that I grew up even with like when Ronald Reagan was in office it's like he was

► 02:27:17
hanging out with Michael Jackson and you know it's like it felt America plus the way the media show things like the American dream was alive and well and even at the same time in the ghetto was a living hell and we were being you know given you know bricks were put on the street bricks of put on the street during the riots now bricks of putting on the street in 80s different kind of brick and there were guns plays and the father

► 02:27:47
being taken out of the hood and this is all this so don't let me say like everything was perfect doing that doing that era but the perception right now perception is more important than it's ever than it's ever been like what we show you know it's just I mean it's out right it's just I don't even want to I don't want to I don't even enjoy dwell on it let's keep going into what you're saying about the debt because also I don't have like if you ask me about

► 02:28:17
of it I can only give you my perspective as a civilian I don't I'm not talking to these the same people you know and also in power the Geniuses I was talking to my man Fred and my boy Anthony about crypto and Bitcoin you know the yesterday just to be prepped for this conversation and not about the specifics of alternate currencies which is like a c which is like Tesla

► 02:28:48
but the there's that my mind just goes on he's like riffs right here but Jack Dorsey decentralized Twitter two months before really hit because he was talking to the Bitcoin guys and these are guys that really have a perspective on what the true liberation of America and Humanity will be these guys a lot of the specific he's got but a lot of the tech guys were able to use the new highways the new information highways and create

► 02:29:17
eight the next Frontier of our existence wow the powers of our political system are still anchoring on Electoral College which was based around slavery about the idea of slaves being 3/5 of men and get this it wasn't even created by Pro slaves 3/5 of Man was created by the NT slaves in the north as a compromise

► 02:29:47
eyes and that basically explains the existence of black people in America to this day the people that were on our side supposedly said we were three fifths of men mmm the people that were on our side the people on our side thought of us as three-fifths of man meaning like yeah come work for us but you know your 3/5 immense eating have electoral college and gerrymandering happening to this date where if you have

► 02:30:18
Latinos blacks other minorities their redrawing the lines to affect the vote to this day that does not relate to the information Highway that we live in today that allow all these you know Tech Guys to become multi billionaires and lead and and and lead free thought or allow you know as best as we could a version of free thought

► 02:30:48
and I gave you a symphony but you see how all this really connects were sticking you know why don't we just keep why are we why we put the white wigs back on they still wear the white wigs out and Yeah England is still where you know that's the whole thing just because you know someone's not you know wearing a KKK uniform or a white wig does it mean that they aren't holding on to the very core of the country being you

► 02:31:17
no based on and built off of slavery so when everyone's saying vote you know that's the reason why my murse is vote Kanye because it's like vote for who look man if you ain't going to say who you voting on out loud don't even wear the vote t-shirt That's So Random right that's so rare and we all these no vote is like Democrat is that because there's nobody is the Trump this like wears a vote t-shirt isn't it funny but it's such a go ahead you can you say that yeah you see vote is mostly vote

► 02:31:47
Democrat like and if you have an American flag mostly you're voting Trump like these are these are realities that we've sort of accept and it's Subs is all this subliminal stuff that's based on like fear and control even like this like this look at this the whole this is the Three-Fifths of man thing right okay

► 02:32:09
the Democrats were willing to take the chance

► 02:32:14
of not winning as long as the conglomerate could be completely in control of as in completely in control you know I'm saying that Bernie yeah Bernie would have one do you want this is something I want to try that I'm saying like Bernie is a superhero yeah you know and he would be the perfect the perfect and Tack the perfect person to be the opposite of what Trump represents yeah there's an

► 02:32:44
this is a guy who's a Social Democrat and you but you know the problem they couldn't control Bernie because you can't you can control and he's been so consistent and so alive so what I'm saying is they literally kicked at this doesn't say something it's like they kick the superhero you know saying they they want to control the same thing they did with Tulsi gabbard but Bernie was interesting because he's just Democratic Socialist because he's got these ideas that are scary to capitalism in I was funny because I created the

► 02:33:14
a birthday party which on the on the next election what's going to happen is I mean you guys got 300 million viewers you know after this would probably be 900 million because you know I run the stock up you know I was a little bit of Bill Cosby in the Jello pudding so so this is a long rant but I really would like to talk to you about

► 02:33:44
if we think okay I mean it was a beautiful long Symphony but there's a there's a cap on it there's a pop and we don't we don't we don't we don't just work here maybe okay we're an endnote ding beginner run away but there's a possibility that I could it's actually technically possible for me to win

► 02:34:09
now which would be the best option for America I would I'm on a 12 ballots and in 17 states that you could write me in on so if people got a people that never voted got up registered voter for me that have to take it take it to the house because I would be you know I could possibly do it now I'm definitely 100% win in 2024 and with that thought I was like okay

► 02:34:39
I got the birthday party but I was thinking

► 02:34:44
maybe there's a possibility I would be

► 02:34:51
they said they wouldn't happen I was thinking I would possibly be the Democrat you know I don't think they would ever let you in like that but I don't know maybe who knows what happens after this Joe Biden Kamala Harris thing who knows who knows what they think you know something I would be the first

► 02:35:09
I'm

► 02:35:14
I'm trying I'm not trying to I'm one of the

► 02:35:19
first

► 02:35:22
Super Famous public black Freewheel Servants of Christ since modern media has come to pass meaning when I when I when I talk I'm not talking for a conglomerate I'm talking for myself in service to God

► 02:35:46
that's it that's it like I'm not you know I'll cover my people cover my family but there's not some big plan or like some practice script thing where it says you go in and you you say this you you do this we've got we want to keep selling Kodak film so we want to stop you know you from bringing out the digital camera we want to keep you know selling this raised at a price of gas so we

► 02:36:16
we're not going to look to how to like safely harness nuclear power to do electric power okay go ahead ask another question I really just I quite love the sound of my own voice as you can see it's fairly it's okay it's his microphone we got me started that sounds great wheezing so we started with student debt got you got on this long Symphony yeah have you given thought into the idea of free education and particularly here's a big one for me as well free healthcare I

► 02:36:46
think if we think of ourselves as a country and our country as a community we're all bunch of people that are together if we're going to take care of things like the fire department if we're going to take care of things like the police department education we've got to take care of health care we got we got to make it so that people get sick they don't go bankrupt we got to make it so that no one has to worry about being taken care of and I don't mean to eliminate the ability for someone to hire a private specialist for

► 02:37:16
surgery anything like that I'm not saying that but I'm saying at the very least we have to cover base medical concerns for the population it's just it's a giant part of what it is to be a person is to worry about your body being broken to worry about being sick to worry about what it's going to cost your family financially and how it could ruin people this is a mean this is a huge issue in our country is medical health

► 02:37:44
so if you thought about that absolutely I hear you and I feel you and I feel what people are going through I think that there is a

► 02:37:56
it's not just how we treat people there's preventative measures yes that can help us from getting sick are our diet our locations are the our jobs there's a lot of that that affects us and puts it in those situated Transportation you know like it wasn't going to like autonomous vehicles and tram systems like just kind of you know trains that are like floating

► 02:38:25
balls are floating Starbucks or something like moving like designing our world to be the world of the future will will help us with health that's the preventive message and then as far as being more inventive in the way we we connect holistic medicine with modern medicine I believe in both medicines I believe in God I believe in God

► 02:38:56
and nature I believe in science and physics and you know it's like the first simplest form of bio engineering I think as farming and to be able to have like I talk about the guys at MIT the greatest scientists in the world those people who are that are like the

► 02:39:25
Lawns of the medical field but perhaps they're sitting there on the on the floors like serving on the front line fighting covid where you know they didn't have the opportunity to create PayPal and become a billionaire and go to the next idea or when they present it and want people to invest in these inventions that they have they haven't had the voice of the platform to bring this invention there's cures to things like one of the things

► 02:39:55
has the Silver Bullet like what what I went through with the medication when they gave me the medication that made me fat but then they said okay we have one that doesn't we all know what a silver bullet is a medication right so it's the it's a medication that goes and just kills exactly what it's supposed to kill but for capitalism that's not the best medication to actually cure people capitalist want to keep people they want to treat them they want to treat

► 02:40:25
I want to keep you sick because that's how you keep making money to have a guy like for me when I say I put my life on the line I think about Abraham Lincoln I think about JFK to go in and sit and say you know the whole thing is know everyone is going to be more prosperous as think is the word now specifically are you going to 5x your money everyone's like trying to know it's about prosperity and to be able to really have real conversations with the lead heads of like

► 02:40:55
big farm and real conversations with the heads of of holistic and and natural healing to put these people in a room together people aren't even have they're mad at each other they're afraid of each other I I donated to a Christian School and Cody and I also went by and saw this other amazing school and in Cody where they have autistic

► 02:41:26
children and kids with special needs in the same classrooms as other as regular kids and I just saw this juxtaposition and the head of that that school is a Christian but it's a state school so there's no prayer in the school and then the other school is fully Christian but it's not a state school so they don't have money and the school and I wanted to have dinner

► 02:41:55
with both of the principles come to find out

► 02:42:02
the principal and these guys they talked maybe at a softball game or something the principal

► 02:42:08
house is one block walking distance the principle of one schools houses one block walking distance from the school of the other principle that were this close right now we have the solutions but we all have our backs to each other we need to face each other and like how we're facing each other right now and have these conversations the solutions for Utopia are in front of us but what's holding us back fear people are sitting on

► 02:42:38
their money really they're sitting under their money I know I'm gonna give you a thing okay that's it next one well did you get did you get my perspective of the real the way I would approach you would bring people together to communicate and try to figure out a better strategy for healthcare I mean in London yeah I was some Financial realities that have to be in London when you go to the hospital

► 02:43:05
not let me give you the American example when I go to hospital I had something wrong my foot 3 years ago

► 02:43:11
they ask me you know do you want to take something do you want a pill I said no five doctors and nurses asked me if I want a pill this is like worse than when you don't accept water on the plane and they just keep it like do you want some more water and I'll take the water out because I don't want to be responsible for the water like when the plane takes off and it goes like this and I got like holding my I don't want no water like I don't even know my like masseuse say that your drink more water so

► 02:43:41
the so they there are like people they have Christmas parties about bonuses about giving out more medication so when we talk about they do look at this how much does the earth cost because there's no price on it right we make money money is not even backed by gold anymore so

► 02:44:01
it's engineering it's where the budgets are going and like it was the best part on one of those parts honor the Sixth Sense is when when they looked at this video and it was a nanny they saw that the nanny was like putting stuff in the like the porch for the child that had passed and he and then they said the ladies looked at it and he said you were keeping her sick

► 02:44:25
you're keeping her sick like we are sick we are sick abortion culture sex culture capitalism we are sick we as a people as a not just the American Society of the world we are sick and we are keeping ourselves sick we're all responsible like the Black Mirror episode we're all responsible in some way we all play some part like if I go to

► 02:44:55
or Hub and the very next thing and I and like backslide and do this because I've struggled with this since I was like 5 years old right and the very next thing says something about like trafficking then I literally would have to like put my hand over that part and like click the thing I'm going to and thinking that like I'm not a part of the the bigger conglomerate that were all all I'm not really a part of

► 02:45:25
the main problem because I'm not as bad as that guy and I'm not looking at this part I'm not like we all play a part of it and we're all sick and some way in the world has been designed to keep us sick like spatial engineering based off faith can save a world literally like building will save the world spatial engineering like engineering not going to Space Engineering our spaces the amount of space that we need the

► 02:45:55
way that we interact with each other how close we are to our loved ones our family how close we are to our jobs we got to experience a lot of this some people it wasn't good some people it's better they were connected with their children and their families in a whole different way like we're talking that this is my thing we could talk about all of these important current issues

► 02:46:17
there's deeper reasons based on the slave mentality based on fear based on protectionism that specifically white supremacy and racism protectionism people just want to protect what they have and there's this like photograph where you're holding the guise of the little girls holding a teddy bear and Jesus has a giant teddy bear behind her her back I mean behind his back she don't want to give up the small teddy bear for the big

► 02:46:47
teddy bear that Jesus has waiting for her there is prosperity for All Families here on Earth right now in service to God there's happiness there's joy it's not a possibility as a probability just the fact that God woke me up got me here safely and allowed me to talk to you right now and Spark the minds of the people that are anointed to change the world is already what God wanted me

► 02:47:17
to do if I didn't take a breath after this point God had me here for this conversation right now but I think God has more from me plan out think they're going to come for me until he dumped until he done with me they ain't gonna come for me and today dumb I want to make it so if someone to sample and put in a Beto be like perfect the really think they go come they ain't gonna come for me until he dumb with me they ain't gonna come for me until he done with me I'm just not yeah yeah

► 02:47:47
help me serve you always creating now yeah but do you understand what I'm saying that you're gonna go okay tell me what I'm saying what you're saying is that it's it's your overall philosophy the way you're approaching life you're approaching life that there is good for everyone it will if we all work together if we all work together in the spirit of the way you think the spirit of God that will not approach this

► 02:48:17
this like with a famine mentality but approach this like there's enough for everybody there's an abundance if we if we engineer correctly if we think about it correctly if we all come together with the spirit of everybody helping everybody this is the spirit of Christianity this is the the good spirit of Christianity not the Christianity that gets despised or disparaged or you know evangelist driving around and private jets the the spirit of goodness and treating each other like brothers and sisters yes but this can be done

► 02:48:47
on a national scale yes because those evangelists are that the people who spread the word of God you know there's people who were praying for me you know we're praying like I said I like to okay yes I am a genius but one of my most genius skill sets is recognizing other Geniuses and empowering them and getting given them the platform so the people that have been praying for me this whole time you know for Jay to work for the Kingdom look at me look at me right

► 02:49:17
here working from the kingdom not not leaning on my ego not leaning on anything but leaning on God and this situation saying let's you know let's rise up together and show people what it's like to be christ-like yeah we fall short you know I mean people love to like look at the Christians that are the least christ-like to judge Christianity as a whole well a lot of people got Jordans in 23 years old and don't very few of them play like LeBron you know they want to be like like Mike but it's

► 02:49:47
very few people that get that close you know it's like yeah and yeah what you're saying is beautiful yeah that they do judge the people that fail people always go to the furthest extent like if you talk about abortion culture people immediately go to rape but don't do the math on what percentage that is and for me as a Christian president you know as I said I go on that I touched on it before I

► 02:50:17
Eli's we're in an imperfect world you know when I talk to my fellow Christians and we talked about meet talk about guns we talked about in this imperfect world there's a transition between where we are today and where we're going there's yeah there's the meat industry have a great impact on the ozone from what I hear it does and we have to transition one of the things I wanted its

► 02:50:47
I thought they came in and thank you for allowing me to give you the thoughts that are coming into my head as opposed to trying to put me on a grid because I'm off the grid period the way I think clearly I paint in circles you know I don't I don't paint inside of the lines right so I was thinking about I forget the lady's name starts with a tea but she changed the meat industry because she was HSP like highly sensitive person that's and put the the cows in a round bends and

► 02:51:17
that's what I'm doing when I say spatial engineering that's what I'm doing with our spaces that I'm designing with the farms and with the school systems the unlearned systems the what are the things that you're going to need you know in the future because 30 years we don't we don't even know we think probably the things that we're learning in school right now won't even apply to people when they're 30 years old that are learning this stuff you know age especially with technology especially with technology in the people who

► 02:51:47
the curriculums are dead however they did way before technology yeah so I mean I was in computer programming when I was 8 years old and I used to know how to program this I got into music and seventh grade I had a Amiga computer that had 4096 colors that's why I got that one and I would program the different Sprites and draw out each of the characters and animate them and I thought that was the next Frontier that I can't because I would do like

► 02:52:17
animation books I wanted to be a animator and then I started doing the the music they had a music program on do the music for the video games and then I found myself running home from school all the way from 95th Street to 119th Street to go and just keep programming the music so this is like 30 age you know 12 13 you know programming video games in that being the Gateway into programming music I got a longer story about that but I know you want to ask me some more serious stuff so

► 02:52:47
ding okay this is a big one the military if you really did become president when excuse me when you do become president you're going to have to deal with hostile governments you're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and dictators you know people in other country that in other countries that don't have a value of human life and throughout history we've had

► 02:53:17
immense problems because of that because of military conflicts how do you think you will approach that

► 02:53:25
me you will be the Commander in Chief of the greatest army the world has ever known if you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of a military action with China would have China takes over Taiwan but if they invade Taiwan

► 02:53:39
what if something happens with Syria what if something happens with Iran what if something happens with Russia and you have to make decisions about military action

► 02:53:52
have you thought about this

► 02:53:56
yes I would

► 02:54:05
I have to say again like covid I'm a civilian and people can have all their perspectives that they can have of what they would do in that situation but I would have the greatest professionals on the planet the most skill people that have all the experience that would present the information and I would make the most sound rational decisions and I would

► 02:54:32
follow God's will in my Approach

► 02:54:41
two

► 02:54:45
to dealing with these other countries to dealing with these other leaders there's there's something about you know

► 02:54:53
our presidents personality and

► 02:54:57
the leader of North Korea is personality where there's

► 02:55:02
there's a level of common respect in and that's the reason why they were able to talk and we the fear had been taken off of us like people who are

► 02:55:17
God fearing

► 02:55:20
self-made

► 02:55:23
Servants of there

► 02:55:27
people

► 02:55:30
these these other you know scary dictators they feel like they're that for their country and if they see

► 02:55:45
a president that they know is just taking a check or a part of a bigger conglomerate now I don't want it like I said I wanted to announce any of the candidates

► 02:55:58
then

► 02:56:02
it's it's very it's very transactional it's

► 02:56:10
and

► 02:56:24
I just said a prayer in this situation this isn't you said the prayer because of what

► 02:56:30
what what what motivated you to say a prayer right there

► 02:56:36
the seriousness the significance of the subject yeah absolutely we can't we can't jump from jokes about this too you know joking about people's lives right we have to completely

► 02:56:49
Be Still In This Moment

► 02:56:52
allow God to guide our steps and ask the right questions

► 02:56:59
with the highest ranking officials possible

► 02:57:04
this isn't something that you just Wing but that you just come in and say I did a bit of research I got this like political answer present going to get a rise out of people like this is this is people's lives this is

► 02:57:20
you know this is a whole different you know setting or mood than what this whole interview has been about this is

► 02:57:31
you know people are suffering and throughout all sides and in Israel and in Nigeria and Haiti we're suffer in the police force in in Chicago and the people the people have been harmed by police and the police were like

► 02:57:51
this all is going to take

► 02:57:54
Serious time like time is love it's going to take that love and that time and

► 02:58:00
moments of listening moments of understanding moments like when my wife goes and visits people in prison and she hears their stories she says I understand I understand why you're into in why you in that situation I would have did the same thing in this situation and for us to go to foreign countries and really understand why that they're you know that they're in these situations

► 02:58:29
why the killing has gone for so long or why the hate has gone so long the why the pain just keeps on you know compounding and compacting

► 02:58:43
there's a empathy that I just have as an artist that it doesn't become a two plus two equals four situation my dad was actually a Psychology major and a Christian therapist and

► 02:59:03
this therapy we talk about therapy period it's like

► 02:59:09
we need healing internationally at just selfishly for America America's number one internationally we need healing and

► 02:59:24
I would lead I would

► 02:59:27
I would lead with

► 02:59:30
with love

► 02:59:34
dignity

► 02:59:37
the responsibility to our country the coverage of our families

► 02:59:42
of our soldiers

► 02:59:49
and in full service to God and to the American people

► 02:59:58
it's the

► 03:00:00
there's a mode that I would be in in that position like when I was a producer and I was a really young man I was running around

► 03:00:14
happen on trains or you know happened turnstile is the stuff and like stealing from cars and I mean that's the only cars but still in clothes from stores and then I was

► 03:00:30
selling music and you know going and buying leather jackets and stuff then you know dating a whole bunch of girls going on tour and then I had a family and I had to adjust a lot of my mentality and behavior to grow and be the man that I needed to be then God called me and I gave my life to Christ

► 03:00:58
and God is helping you to be the Christian that I need to be and when it's in God's will that I become the leader I will become the leader that I need to be so right now as I said I'm a civilian but my heart my mind and my spirit is it a place where I feel I know that I'm being I'm being called to Captain this ship like when Roosevelt went in

► 03:01:27
could was in shambles when I say those things about those numbers and when I went to Adidas when I went to Gap like I'm the person that you actually call when things are not going so well you know you had that the mob movies is the guy that goes cleans up everything and I put everything I'm like the forensic we're in the same way how you saw my mind touch on 10 things at a time and then I had to say ten sentences at a time if I can say I'm a

► 03:01:57
maybe narrow them down to seven

► 03:02:01
that's the way my mind takes you no information in and then in synthesize it and it comes out as a song or comes out as a product using that mentality as a leader Fearless God-fearing

► 03:02:16
we will heal we will show the world what America

► 03:02:21
should be the dream you said all this shit all the things that you've said and the most non-politician way I've ever heard anybody describe these things I know you really mean these things this is this is uh it's a resonating with me that you're being a hundred percent honest and natural and that's that's what we're missing in politics today mean it's one of the things that made people excited about Trump as at least he was an alternative to the political talk who's an

► 03:02:51
two politicians speak where you know they're being dishonest and disingenuous but you just accept it you know they're reading things that have been written by speechwriters but you just accept it because it says the things that you want to hear checks the boxes that will say okay you got my vote what you're saying though is what you really feel and you really think and you're not saying that like a politician and that's what's going to resonate and people going to be mad at me if you get pregnant you can present ago you made Kanye West seemed like a bubble u-turn

► 03:03:21
and him into the fucking president you made him seem like a rational choice for president this conversation exposes a side of you that I don't think anybody's ever seen before and a long form conversation where you realize that you are a Visionary you do you do have these ideas are real you're not posing it's not bullshit this is who you are and your well-thought-out response particularly to the idea of military conflict it's very impressive man praise God I'm glad I did that

► 03:03:51
dear brother isn't with three hours into this let's wrap this up on a beautiful high note so people can write you in if they want to and we have a we have a video on that Brian yeah so Brian I'll play this video on how they can write you in and we'll wrap it up here

► 03:04:12
here it is how to write in Kanye West on your ballot now for people that are watching this on YouTube you'll be able to watch this and on on Spotify you'll be able to watch this but if you're just listening you just got to go down to the part where it says or right in it's pretty straightforward write-in candidates it'll show you where you can write it in this video will be available this video is on YouTube right it's on is that Twitter it's on Twitter okay

► 03:04:42
right in Kanye West on your ballot it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this I'll tell you man that was one of the most interesting and impressive answers to any question because it was so obvious that you were you were coming from the heart and that's that's what we all need right now we all need no bullshit absolutely thank you brother this is an honor really thank you pleasure I'm glad we finally did it yeah awesome this won't be the last time all right
